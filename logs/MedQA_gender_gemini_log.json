The patient presents with a one-month history of fluctuating binocular diplopia, predominantly on upward and primary gaze, worsening with exertion and improving with rest. She also reports proximal muscle weakness, primarily in the upper limbs, also exhibiting a fatigable pattern. This, combined with the positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the decremental response on EMG, strongly suggests myasthenia gravis. However, I'd like to explore a few points. First, while the nerve conduction studies weren't available, I'd like to ensure they are performed to rule out any other neuromuscular junction disorders like Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). Although LEMS is less likely given the proximal weakness and lack of autonomic symptoms, it's important to differentiate. Second, the patient mentions heavy legs and some difficulty climbing stairs.

The single fiber EMG is a good suggestion as well, especially if the NCS is normal. I'll schedule those tests. Regarding the leg weakness, I was also thinking along the lines of formal strength testing. Specifically, I'd like to assess for fatigability in the lower extremities as well. Perhaps a timed stair climb test or repeated sit-to-stand assessments could help quantify any fatigable weakness that might be more subtle than what we're seeing in the upper limbs. Could the \"heavy legs\" sensation, even without overt weakness on examination, still be a manifestation of MG, or are there other neuromuscular conditions that might present with this symptom in the absence of clear weakness? I'm thinking about conditions like mitochondrial myopathies, although the time course and other symptoms don't"

Given the patient's age and the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, are there any other autoimmune conditions we should consider in the differential, even alongside a likely MG diagnosis? I'm thinking about conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, which can sometimes have neuromuscular manifestations. Should we consider any specific autoimmune panels at this stage? Also, while the patient hasn't reported any respiratory symptoms, given the potential for myasthenic crisis, should we consider baseline pulmonary function tests (PFTs)?

Given the potential for rapid deterioration with intussusception, should we also consider starting IV fluids preemptively while we wait for the ultrasound results, to address the dehydration and optimize him for a potential enema procedure? 2. Regarding the enema, if the ultrasound confirms intussusception, what are your preferred parameters for an air enema in terms of pressure and duration? And what would be the threshold for switching to a contrast enema if air is unsuccessful? 3. While we suspect intussusception, the history of recent pea introduction makes me wonder about other, less common causes of obstruction.

While I strongly suspect AIN, I'd like to explore a few other possibilities and get your opinion. Given his existing hypertension and use of lisinopril, could his presentation be related to some degree of pre-existing chronic kidney disease being exacerbated by the antibiotic, rather than a purely acute interstitial nephritis? Could the elevated creatinine and urea be, in part, due to a slight decrease in renal function related to an interaction with the amoxicillin, superimposed on a chronic baseline impairment?

Also, should we consider other systemic diseases that can sometimes manifest with interstitial nephritis, such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome or sarcoidosis, even though these are less likely given the acute presentation?

The absence of a pop, locking, or significant effusion argues against a meniscal tear, although some meniscal irritation can't be entirely ruled out. The negative valgus and varus stress tests also support the absence of ligamentous injury. The x-ray confirms no bony pathology.

One final question: We've focused on cardiac causes, and rightfully so. However, given his age (once I confirm it), should we also consider a carotid ultrasound to assess for carotid artery stenosis, especially if the syncope recurs? While less likely given the circumstances, could carotid sinus hypersensitivity be a contributing factor, particularly in an older patient?

This is unusual, especially given the reported rapid growth. My initial differential includes phyllodes tumor, given the rapid growth, but the hardness is less typical. A fibroadenoma is also possible, but again, the rapid growth is atypical. Of course, malignancy, particularly a rapidly proliferative type, can't be ruled out. I've asked the patient about the size difference between when she first noticed the mass and its current size to try and quantify the growth rate.

I'm thinking particularly about the potential cosmetic outcome for the patient, and whether margin width recommendations differ based on the histological subtype (benign, borderline, or malignant) of the phyllodes tumor.

Regarding rapidly growing fibroadenomas, the size criterion of >4cm is helpful. Would you also consider the *rate* of growth as a factor, even if the current size is less than 4cm?

I'm trying to reconcile that with the patient's denial of a palpable mass. Could this be a situation where the patient simply isn't aware of how to properly perform a self-exam?

First, regarding the PCL, while a dashboard impact can certainly cause this injury, is there anything specific about the *posterior* hip dislocation that might increase the likelihood of a concomitant PCL tear? I\u2019m trying to gauge the pre-test probability here. Second, given the patient\u2019s report of bilateral knee pain, albeit more severe on the right, should we consider imaging the left knee as well?

Regarding complete ruptures, you mentioned conservative management is an option if the avulsion fragment is small and minimally displaced. Since our initial X-ray didn't show any avulsion fracture, does that effectively rule out a complete rupture in this case, or could a complete tendon rupture occur without a bony fragment? Also, in terms of surgical repair for complete ruptures, what is the typical recovery time and what are the potential complications? Regarding the simple sprain scenario, you mentioned buddy taping and early ROM exercises. Could you elaborate on the type of ROM exercises you recommend and when they should be initiated? Is there a risk of exacerbating the injury with early mobilization in these cases? Finally, for pain management, what dosage and duration of NSAIDs do you typically recommend for both sprains and"

I did ask the patient about insect bites, and while they recalled mosquito bites, they didn't specifically mention ticks. However, given their hiking history, a tick bite is certainly plausible even if unrecalled. Before starting streptomycin, I'd like to clarify a few things to further refine our differential and ensure we're covering all bases. First, could we get more detail about the character of the ankle swelling? Is it specifically localized to the lymph nodes, or is it more diffuse? This will help distinguish between lymphadenopathy and other causes of swelling. Second, while the lesion's appearance and progression strongly suggest tularemia, I'd like to consider other infections like sporotrichosis, especially given the outdoor exposure. Could we also add a fungal culture to the biopsy sample? Finally, given the necrotic center, we should also"

I will ask the patient about animal contact, specifically rabbits, as that's a common vector for tularemia. Regarding the ankle swelling, I agree clarifying the nature of the swelling is crucial. If it's diffuse and not localized to lymph nodes, it could point towards something else entirely, like a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although the lack of other DVT risk factors and the presence of the ulcer make this less likely. Cellulitis is another possibility, but the necrotic center of the ulcer makes typical cellulitis less probable.

While the location of the herniation explains the patient's radicular symptoms down the lateral leg (likely affecting the S1 nerve root), I'd like your opinion \u2013 does the imaging suggest any other potential contributing factors, such as foraminal stenosis or spondylolisthesis, that we should consider? Also, given the severity of pain (8-9/10) and the neurological symptoms, what are your initial thoughts on management \u2013 are we considering conservative treatment initially or would you lean towards surgical intervention given the significant nerve impingement?"

Could this be contributing to the high pain level? Second, regarding physical therapy, are there specific modalities or exercises you'd recommend or advise against at this stage, considering the L5-S1 location and lateral leg pain?

Also, regarding cauda equina syndrome, while I agree it's crucial to monitor for, the patient currently denies any bowel or bladder dysfunction. Should we consider ordering a post-void residual urine volume measurement as a baseline, or would you prefer to wait and see if any such symptoms develop?

Good point about the blood cultures \u2013 I'll add those to the labs as well. The gram stain of the synovial fluid was negative, which is somewhat common in DGI.

So, it sounds like the urinary symptoms preceded the arthritis. However, given the patient's sexual history with new partners, DGI still seems more likely than reactive arthritis, even with the preceding dysuria.

Importantly, there's no blood in the stool, no weight loss, and no reported fever. Initial blood work including CBC and ESR are normal, as is a routine stool examination. Fecal calprotectin is also within normal limits, making IBD less likely. The patient reports regular caffeine and alcohol intake, a mixed diet without any specific trigger foods identified, and Imodium has been ineffective. My primary thought is IBS, given the symptom cluster of abdominal pain relieved by defecation, altered bowel habits (chronic diarrhea), bloating, and the absence of alarming features like blood, weight loss, and fever. The normal calprotectin further supports this. However, I want to explore a few other possibilities before settling on that diagnosis. First, given the"

However, a trial of cholestyramine seems reasonable given the limited other findings. Regarding microscopic colitis, that's also a valid point. While the normal fecal calprotectin makes inflammatory conditions less likely, it doesn't entirely rule out microscopic colitis. Before we proceed with a trial of cholestyramine or a colonoscopy with biopsies for microscopic colitis, I have a few more questions based on the specialist's recommendations: 1. Could we ask the patient about the volume and consistency of the diarrhea more specifically? For example, do they feel the need to urgently rush to the bathroom due to a large volume of stool, or is it more of an urgency related to cramping and discomfort? This might help"

Before we potentially jump to a SeHCAT scan, I'd like to try the cholestyramine trial first, as it's both diagnostic and therapeutic. If the patient responds well, it would strongly suggest BAD and avoid the need for a more invasive procedure. Regarding microscopic colitis, while I agree it's still on the differential, the normal calprotectin, absence of blood, and lack of significant inflammatory markers in the CBC make it slightly less probable in my view.

However, it's a relatively simple test and could rule out another possibility. Before we initiate these, I'd like to gather a bit more information from the patient to further refine our differential and potentially prioritize our next steps. Specifically, I want to ask the patient about: 1. **Stool volume and urgency:** As we discussed, differentiating between urgency related to volume versus cramping is important in considering BAD. I'll ask something like, \"When you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, is it because you feel a large amount of stool needs to come out, or is it more of a cramping sensation that makes you need"

She denies fever, chills, night sweats, pelvic pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel or bladder habits (though she reports increased urinary frequency, which she attributes to increased water intake). She has a family history of uterine cancer in her grandmother. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, despite the normal CA-125. We know it's not a reliable marker, particularly in early-stage disease. Given the ascites and pleural effusion, I'm concerned about the possibility of advanced disease.

A CT chest/abdomen/pelvis has already been performed which revealed the ascites, pleural effusion, and the ovarian mass. I'm glad you concur about the possibility of ovarian cancer despite the normal CA-125. Given the patient's age and presentation, are there any other less common ovarian tumor types we should be considering, such as a germ cell tumor or a sex cord-stromal tumor? While less frequent, they can present with similar symptoms. Should we add any other tumor markers to the workup, like AFP, beta-hCG, or inhibin, to help differentiate these possibilities pre-operatively? Finally, given the pleural effusion, would you recommend a thoracentesis for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes before the surgical consult?"

While we've discussed germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumors, are there any other rare ovarian malignancies, such as a small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type, or a malignant mixed M\u00fcllerian tumor, that we should keep in our differential, even if remotely?

Before we conclude, I'd like to revisit the patient's family history of uterine cancer. While not directly ovarian, could this suggest a potential hereditary predisposition to gynecological malignancies, such as Lynch syndrome? Should we consider genetic testing for the patient, perhaps after the initial surgical evaluation and biopsy? While I understand the focus should remain on the immediate diagnosis and treatment, understanding any underlying genetic predisposition could inform long-term management and screening for the patient and potentially her family members."

I will make a note to discuss this with the patient and ensure it's incorporated into her long-term care plan. Before we conclude, I want to circle back to the patient's pleural effusion. While a thoracentesis will help characterize the fluid, I'm wondering if we should also consider a cytology examination of the pleural fluid specifically for malignant cells? Given the possibility of advanced ovarian cancer, could the pleural effusion represent metastatic spread? Would this influence the surgical approach or treatment plan in any way? Additionally, are there any specific imaging findings from the CT scan, beyond the presence of the effusion itself, that we should be looking for to suggest malignant involvement of the pleura?"
