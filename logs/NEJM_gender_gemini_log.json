However, I have a few questions and thoughts I'd like to discuss. First, the patient mentioned the cream was purchased online. This raises concerns about quality control and the possibility of a higher than advertised hydroquinone concentration, or the presence of other potentially harmful ingredients. Have you seen similar cases related to online skincare purchases? Second, while the biopsy confirms ochronosis, it doesn't rule out the possibility of co-existing melasma, which the patient was initially trying to treat. Could the initial improvement she reported be related to the melasma responding to the hydroquinone before the ochronosis"

Given the patient's dry and sensitive skin, and her report of increased sun sensitivity since using the cream, I'm wondering if there could be a component of phototoxic or photoallergic reaction contributing to the clinical picture. Could the hydroquinone have made her skin more susceptible to sun damage, exacerbating the hyperpigmentation? Also, are there any other ingredients commonly found in these types of online creams that we should be considering as potential culprits, even if they weren't listed on the label? Finally, regarding treatment, given her sensitive skin, what are your thoughts on starting with a conservative approach like topical antioxidants and sun protection, alongside discontinuation of the hydroquinone, before considering more aggressive options like lasers or peels?

Also, regarding the retinoid, I'm still a bit hesitant given her dry and sensitive skin. Perhaps we could start with a very low concentration and advise her to use it only every other night, or even less frequently, to minimize irritation. What specific retinoid would you recommend in this situation? And would you suggest combining it with a gentle moisturizer to mitigate potential dryness?

The elevated eosinophil count hinted at a parasitic infection, possibly acquired in Brazil, especially with the history of consuming a \"muddy\"-tasting fish at the grandfather's farm. However, the parasite panel came back negative. The patient also reports flu-like symptoms, which, combined with the recent travel history and presence of mosquitos at the farm, raises the possibility of a mosquito-borne illness.

The significantly elevated LDH combined with the skin biopsy showing intravascular aggregates of atypical B-cells strongly suggests Intravascular Large B-cell Lymphoma (IVLBCL), as you mentioned. However, the absence of neurological symptoms is somewhat atypical in IVLBCL, where neurological involvement is common. My primary concern is confirming the IVLBCL diagnosis and ruling out other potential differentials. While the normal CBC, CMP, HIV, RPR, and ANA help narrow the possibilities, I'd like to explore a few points: 1. **Could you elaborate on the specific morphology of the atypical lymphocytes seen in the biopsy?** Were they large, with prominent nucleoli?

Flow cytometry on the skin biopsy, as you suggested, is an excellent idea to further confirm the B-cell lineage and explore the possibility of other rarer intravascular lymphomas. The bone marrow biopsy is crucial, even with the atypical presentation lacking neurological symptoms. While bone marrow involvement is less common in IVLBCL, it can occur, and staging is essential for treatment planning. I'll schedule that immediately.

However, I'll re-address this question with the patient, specifically asking about any unintentional weight loss over the past three to six months, even if it seems minor. Sometimes patients don't perceive gradual weight loss as significant. While the elevated LDH and the skin biopsy findings strongly suggest IVLBCL, the absence of neurological symptoms and the possibility of concurrent infection make me want to consider a few other less likely, but important differentials.

The patient presents with a classic triad of constrictive pericarditis: exertional dyspnea, peripheral edema, and ascites (manifesting as bloating). The echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis with findings of pericardial calcification, ventricular interdependence, and pleural effusions. Given her history of working in a textile factory with asbestos exposure, I'm strongly leaning towards a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis secondary to asbestos exposure. However, we need to consider other potential causes of constrictive pericarditis. My primary concern is the asbestos exposure. While it significantly increases the likelihood of asbestos-related pericarditis, other etiologies can mimic this presentation. My questions are: 1. Do you agree with my initial assessment of constrictive pericarditis based on the presented findings? 2.

Given the patient's age and the chronicity of her symptoms, I'm particularly interested in ruling out restrictive cardiomyopathy. While the echocardiogram findings point towards constrictive pericarditis, the two can sometimes be difficult to differentiate clinically. The MRI should help distinguish between pericardial thickening and inherent myocardial abnormalities.

Could this delayed presentation and progression suggest a partial or localized immune deficiency, even in the absence of other systemic symptoms?

Regarding bullous pemphigoid, while the chronicity fits, the linear distribution and the positive Tzanck smear make it less probable, correct? Are there any other features we should look for that might distinguish between shingles and bullous pemphigoid, aside from the biopsy results?

While chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and ABPA often respond well to corticosteroids, MAC and other less common infections might require a more targeted antibiotic regimen. Therefore, in addition to the AFB stains and cultures, could we also consider adding fungal cultures to the BAL if performed? This would help us rule out less common fungal pathogens, especially considering the negative initial sputum culture.

Also, regarding the bronchoscopy, if we proceed with that, would you recommend transbronchial biopsies in addition to the BAL, particularly if the BAL cultures are negative?

I understand that in CAD, the agglutination is often more pronounced at lower temperatures. Also, considering the initial presentation with jaundice and dark urine, even though the liver function tests haven't been mentioned, should we revisit liver function tests and perhaps a bilirubin fractionation to assess for any underlying or concurrent hepatic involvement?

Interestingly, he reports itching in the groin area, particularly after gym class where he wears compression shorts, starting roughly a month after the hematuria began. My primary concern, given the constellation of findings, is a hypersensitivity reaction or contact dermatitis affecting the urinary tract. The timeline suggests the hematuria may have preceded the external irritation, but it's possible they are related.

The elevated eosinophils also point away from IC and more towards an allergic/inflammatory process. However, before we settle on contact dermatitis as the sole explanation, I think we should consider a few other possibilities, albeit less likely ones: 1. **Could there be a low-grade infection we're missing?** While the urine culture was negative, it's possible a fastidious organism or a non-bacterial pathogen like a fungus or parasite could be involved. I'd suggest a repeat urinalysis and culture, perhaps with specialized staining or PCR testing to broaden our search. 2. **"

Before we proceed, I have a few additional thoughts and questions: 1. **Regarding the eosinophilia:** While a high eosinophil count often suggests an allergic or parasitic process, it can also be seen in certain drug reactions and some autoimmune conditions. While the patient denies new medications, it's worth double-checking for any over-the-counter medications, supplements, or even topical agents he might be using that we haven't discussed yet. Could we also consider checking a serum IgE level? While not always elevated in allergic reactions, it could provide additional supporting evidence. 2. **Regarding the compression shorts:** While the timeline suggests the hematuria predates the itching associated with the shorts, it'"

However, I'd like to propose one additional, relatively non-invasive test to consider alongside these: a patch test. Given the suspicion of contact dermatitis related to the compression shorts, a patch test could help identify any specific allergens contributing to the groin irritation. This could be particularly helpful if the avoidance measures don't fully resolve the symptoms. Even if the primary driver of the hematuria is something else, identifying and eliminating contact allergens could improve his overall comfort and potentially reduce any secondary inflammation in the area.

Given the patient's long-standing COPD and use of inhaled corticosteroids, could this contribute to the white plaques or influence the appearance of the larynx in any way? Should we consider any specific fungal infections, given the inhaled steroid use, even though he doesn't report classic thrush symptoms?

A dermatologist specializes in skin conditions, including those affecting the genitals, and is best equipped to diagnose and manage less common or more complex skin disorders that may be mimicking STIs. Since the standard STI investigations have yielded no results, a dermatologist's expertise in skin-specific conditions is now the most relevant."
