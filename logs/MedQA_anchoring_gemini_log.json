This patient presents with a one-month history of progressively worsening binocular diplopia, proximal upper limb weakness, and neck weakness, all exacerbated by exertion and improving with rest. The symptoms are worse in the evenings. She also reports right-sided ptosis, also worsening as the day progresses. There are no reported swallowing, chewing, or speech difficulties, muscle twitching, or family history of neurological conditions. The clinical picture, particularly the fluctuating weakness and diplopia exacerbated by use, strongly suggests **myasthenia gravis (MG)**. The presence of ptosis further strengthens this suspicion. The neurological examination showing right eyelid ptosis worsening with sustained upward gaze and diminished motor strength in the upper extremities without atrophy also points towards a neuromuscular junction disorder. The test results showing elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies and a positive decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation in the EMG essentially confirm the diagnosis of MG. The normal chest CT scan rules out a thy"

I haven't specifically asked about respiratory symptoms, but I will follow up with the patient about any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing deeply, or decreased exercise tolerance. Given the neck muscle weakness, I'm particularly concerned about potential respiratory involvement, even if she's not overtly symptomatic. While corticosteroids can provide rapid symptom relief, I'm hesitant to initiate them immediately without a thorough assessment of her respiratory function. A rapid decline in respiratory function, although rare, can occur with corticosteroids in MG patients, particularly if there's underlying weakness. Therefore, I'd like to obtain pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF), before starting steroids. This will establish a baseline and help us monitor for any potential deterioration. Would you agree with this approach? Also,"

Wouldn't you agree that a single fiber EMG is likely unnecessary, adding cost and patient discomfort without significantly changing management? I'm leaning towards starting pyridostigmine once we have the PFTs back and are confident about her respiratory reserve. What are your thoughts on initiating pyridostigmine while we consider longer-term immunomodulatory therapy like azathioprine or mycophenolate? Also, given the absence of a thymoma on the CT scan, would you recommend a thymectomy in this patient?

I\u2019ll make sure she understands the potential for drug-free remission, but also the surgical risks and the lack of guarantee of complete remission. Before we conclude, I wanted to touch on a couple of other points. First, are there any other autoimmune conditions we should consider screening for, given the diagnosis of MG?

Finally, while we're fairly certain about the diagnosis of MG, are there any other, less common, neuromuscular junction disorders that we should keep in mind, even if just remotely?

First, while the MRI findings are highly suggestive of PML, are there any other differential diagnoses we should consider, even if less likely, given the clinical picture and Natalizumab use? For example, could an atypical demyelinating process, perhaps related to the Crohn's itself, be playing a role? I understand this is less probable, but I want to be thorough.

Could we consider a brain biopsy, even though it's invasive, to definitively rule out other less likely possibilities, such as a lymphoma or an unusual inflammatory process related to the Crohn's disease? While I appreciate the urgency of managing the PML, having a definitive pathological diagnosis could influence long-term management, especially if there's an underlying process contributing to the asymmetry.

Perhaps instead of a biopsy, we could consider a lumbar puncture to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)? While it won't provide a tissue diagnosis, it could offer additional information. Specifically, we could look for JC virus DNA in the CSF, which would further solidify the PML diagnosis. Additionally, CSF analysis could help rule out other inflammatory or infectious processes, even if less likely, and potentially shed light on the asymmetry. What are your thoughts on that?

Regarding anorectal manometry, would you recommend performing that before or after the rectal biopsy? I'm leaning towards doing the biopsy first given its higher diagnostic yield for Hirschsprung's, and then proceeding to manometry if needed. Also, in terms of the biopsy itself, do you have a preference for suction or full-thickness biopsy? I understand suction biopsies are generally less invasive, but a full-thickness biopsy might provide more information in some cases. Finally, while we await the biopsy results, should we consider any initial management strategies for the infant's discomfort and potential obstruction, such as nasogastric decompression or IV fluids? He's showing signs of dehydration with the reduced urine output, and I'm concerned about the potential for further complications if the obstruction isn't addressed promptly"

Regarding the timing of the anorectal manometry, you suggested we perform it if the biopsy is equivocal. By equivocal, do you mean if the biopsy shows hypoganglionosis but not a complete absence of ganglion cells? Or are there other scenarios where you'd find manometry helpful even with a seemingly definitive biopsy result? 2. While we're waiting for the biopsy results, are there any specific parameters we should monitor closely besides the obvious hydration status and bowel decompression? Should we be looking at electrolyte levels particularly closely, given the potential for shifts with the NG decompression and IV fluids? 3.

While the lack of cough or other respiratory symptoms makes this less likely, it's worth considering.

However, I want to be thorough. With the flow cytometry, should we also consider adding tests for infectious mononucleosis (given the elevated WBC and fatigue) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), just to rule out those possibilities?

Should we consider imaging, such as a renal ultrasound or CT angiogram, to rule out other structural abnormalities or vascular issues?

My main concern with pursuing the renovascular disease angle is that the patient's pain is unilateral and described as a constant dull ache, rather than the more typical episodic, colicky pain associated with renovascular hypertension. Do you think the patient's existing hypertension makes renovascular disease more likely in this context, even with the atypical pain presentation? Also, given the patient's negative urine culture and lack of urinary symptoms, are there any other infectious etiologies we should consider besides pyelonephritis, perhaps something viral or fungal, given the recent antibiotic use could have disrupted their normal flora?

Also, while the eosinophils will help guide us, are there any other specific lab tests you'd recommend at this stage, such as a urine eosinophil count or a more comprehensive metabolic panel to assess electrolyte balance and liver function, given the potential for systemic effects of AIN?

She reports intermittent clicking but no locking, giving way, or swelling. There's no history of prior knee injury. My initial differential includes medial meniscus tear, MCL sprain, and patellofemoral pain syndrome. I've ordered an MRI to help clarify the diagnosis. My primary concern leans towards a meniscus tear given the mechanism of injury and the location of the pain. The intermittent clicking also supports this. However, the lack of significant effusion or locking makes me consider other possibilities. An MCL sprain is also possible given the twisting motion during volleyball, but the pain location is slightly atypical. Patellofemoral pain syndrome is less likely given the acute onset and clear mechanism of injury,"

A couple of questions for you: While pes anserine bursitis and plica syndrome are now higher on my differential, the mechanism of injury \u2013 pivoting and twisting during volleyball \u2013 still suggests a meniscal or ligamentous injury.

Given that the patient is a young female with PCOS and taking birth control pills, are there any hormonal or metabolic considerations that might predispose her to these types of inflammatory conditions, or influence our interpretation of the MRI findings? I'm thinking particularly about how PCOS can sometimes affect inflammation and soft tissue health. Also, considering the patient's ongoing weight loss and increased activity, should we consider adding a basic metabolic panel to the workup, to rule out any electrolyte imbalances or other metabolic derangements that might be contributing to muscle pain or weakness, potentially mimicking or exacerbating a musculoskeletal issue?

Given her pain being just below the kneecap, medially, and her report of intermittent clicking, I'm still somewhat suspicious of a possible medial meniscus tear, perhaps a small peripheral tear, or a discoid meniscus. While the lack of effusion and locking doesn't fit the classic presentation, these findings aren't always present, especially in smaller tears. Could the MRI miss a small peripheral tear, even with fat suppression? Are there any specific sequences or techniques that might improve the sensitivity for detecting these subtle tears?

I'm curious, given the lack of prodromal symptoms typically associated with vasovagal syncope (like nausea, sweating, or lightheadedness), what other differentials are you considering at this point besides arrhythmias? Could this presentation be suggestive of something like a transient ischemic attack (TIA), even though he didn't have any focal neurological deficits? Should we consider a carotid ultrasound or even a brain MRI? Also, while we wait for the lab results, including the"

Three days old is a period of significant adjustment, and crying is a primary means of communication. * **Feeding Issues:** While the parent reported no latching or spitting up issues, we don't know the feeding type or frequency.

The prolonged labor, vaginal delivery, and perineal tear are all risk factors. * **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** Increased urinary frequency raises this possibility, though the absence of dysuria makes it less likely.

Before we order the CT, I'd like to get the results of the STAT CBC, urinalysis, and blood cultures.

Before I speak with the patient again, I wanted to get your opinion on a couple of other points: 1. Given the description of the prolapsed mass as easily reducible and non-tender, how likely is it that this is *solely* a hemorrhoid, even if it's contributing to the bleeding? Could there be a concomitant rectal polyp or other lesion that's also bleeding and contributing to the mass? Should we consider a proctoscopy with biopsy even if we proceed with a sigmoidoscopy or FIT test? 2"

Could it provide any additional information in this context, or would it be more of a distraction given the likely benign etiology? 2.

Concurrently, we'll re-address the FIT test, highlighting its simplicity and utility as a screening tool, particularly if the patient remains hesitant about any invasive procedure.

Also, while the posterior dislocation is clear, the patient mentioned feeling a deep, unsettling ache and instability in the hip, even beyond the expected pain of the dislocation.

And secondly, did your baby pass any meconium plug, which would be a thick, dark green, almost tar-like stool, shortly after birth? Patient: (Patient Response Here) Doctor: Thank you. And one last question, while I'm thinking about it, did the doctors notice anything unusual about your baby's anus immediately after birth, like it being imperforate (meaning it didn't have an opening)?

Given the dilated bowel loops on the X-ray, I'm leaning away from a simple meconium plug. Before we proceed with the biopsy and enema, I'd like to clarify a couple of points. While the midwives reported a normal anal opening, did they perform a digital rectal exam? Sometimes a tight anal sphincter can mimic some of these symptoms, and a gentle digital exam might reveal that. It's a long shot, but worth considering.

While Hirschsprung's remains my primary concern, the lack of any explosive expulsion of stool following the digital rectal exam (which can sometimes happen in Hirschsprung's) would further solidify that suspicion. Assuming the digital rectal exam doesn't reveal anything conclusive, I agree that the contrast enema is the next best step. It can help us visualize the colon and potentially identify the level of obstruction more precisely. Furthermore, as you mentioned, it has therapeutic potential, though I suspect the chances of a simple meconium plug are low in this case. Following the contrast enema, if the diagnosis is still"

I'm leaning towards that being the issue rather than a central slip injury, as those typically present with an inability to actively extend the PIP joint, which doesn't seem to be the case here. The mechanism of injury, with forced hyperextension at the DIP, also points more towards a volar plate injury. Before we order the MRI, could we discuss the practicality of splinting in slight flexion? Since he's a student, writing might be difficult with that type of immobilization. Would a custom splint allowing for PIP joint flexion while maintaining DIP joint flexion be a reasonable alternative, or would that compromise healing? Also, what are your thoughts on early range of motion exercises after a week or two of splinting, assuming the MRI confirms a simple sprain or a small, stable avulsion fracture?"

One more question \u2013 given the mechanism of injury, is there a possibility of a dorsal capsule injury accompanying the volar plate injury? While the primary concern is the volar plate given the extension lag, I'm wondering if the forced hyperextension could have also stretched or damaged the dorsal capsule. Should we be looking for any specific signs of this on the MRI, or would the management remain the same regardless? Also, what's your preferred follow-up schedule for this type of injury? I was thinking a check-in after the MRI, then again after a week or two in the splint to assess ROM and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Does that"

I just want to be clear on when surgical intervention might be considered for a volar plate avulsion. Would that typically be reserved for larger, displaced fractures, or cases where conservative management fails to restore function? Also, regarding the follow-up, should we consider a referral to hand therapy after the initial immobilization period, especially if he continues to experience stiffness or limited ROM? And finally, what are your thoughts on the use of NSAIDs for pain management in this situation?

It's now purplish with a dark, almost black, center, raised, and surrounded by warm, tender skin. He describes the pain as a constant burning sensation, worsened when the leg is dependent. No purulent or bloody discharge is noted. He denies fever, chills, or lymphadenopathy. He has a history of type 2 diabetes, Crohn's disease, hypertension, and a recent episode of uveitis. His medications include insulin, mesalamine, enalapril, and aspirin. He recalls a possible ant bite at the site about a month ago. He has travelled domestically to Wisconsin recently but not internationally. My primary concern is the possibility of a complicated skin and soft tissue infection, potentially necrotizing fasciitis, given the rapid progression, pain, discoloration, and surrounding erythema."

Given the patient's history of Crohn's and recent uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum is definitely on my differential. The lesion's appearance also fits that picture. Ecthyma gangrenosum is less likely in my opinion, as it's typically associated with Pseudomonas bacteremia and this patient doesn't appear systemically ill. Although he visited Wisconsin, the lesion doesn't seem to follow the typical lymphangitic spread we see with sporotrichosis. Could you elaborate on what specific aspects of the presentation make you consider sporotrichosis? Also, given his diabetes and the potential for a deeper infection, should we consider obtaining blood cultures and inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR?

The classic triad of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and fetal distress (implied by the cessation of fetal movement after pain onset) strongly supports this.

I'll double-check the imaging myself for signs of retroplacental hematoma or other suggestive features. While a complete abruption could certainly contribute to her presentation, the localized nature of the uterine wall disruption described in the ultrasound makes me lean more towards rupture at the scar site as the primary event, with the bleeding potentially secondarily affecting the placental attachment.

Given her rapid deterioration (now dizzy and lightheaded), I'm increasingly concerned about the degree of hemorrhage. Even with the massive transfusion protocol, I'm wondering if we should consider hypogastric artery ligation or uterine artery embolization as potential adjunctive measures for hemorrhage control *during* the surgery, should direct pressure and conventional methods prove insufficient. What are your thoughts on having interventional radiology on standby, just in case? While less likely given the ultrasound findings, could the bleeding be"

While I think uterine rupture is still the most likely diagnosis, the possibility of percreta/increta raises a couple of questions. Did the ultrasound report comment on the placental location or its relationship to the myometrium? Specifically, was there any mention of abnormal placental invasion or thinning of the uterine wall? This information would help stratify the risk of percreta/increta and further inform our intraoperative approach. Also, given the patient's now reported dizziness and lightheadedness, indicating likely worsening hemodynamic instability, I'm concerned about delaying surgery even for a few more minutes to obtain additional imaging.

The positive straight leg raise test (implied by the pain worsening with movement) and the MRI findings confirming the L5-S1 herniation with nerve root impingement all point towards this diagnosis. However, before we settle on surgical intervention, I'd like to discuss a few points. First, while the patient denies any history of back pain, it's worth exploring further if there were any prior, less severe episodes that he might have dismissed. This could give us a better understanding of any underlying predisposing factors. Second, I'm curious about the specific mechanism of injury during the deadlift.

While less likely than a disc herniation, it's a possibility we should consider. 2.

While the fundus exam should reveal a detachment, an ultrasound might provide additional information, especially if media opacity from something like vitritis is present, hindering a clear view of the retina. Also, while we wait for the viral load results, what level would be considered consistent with active CMV replication and increase our suspicion for CMV retinitis? Finally, regarding treatment, if the fundus exam and PCR confirm CMV retinitis, would you recommend starting intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir initially?

While Lyme disease is a possibility, the urinary symptoms and sexual history still make reactive arthritis/DGI more probable in my mind. I'm curious, in your experience, how often do you see reactive arthritis present with such a pronounced monoarthritis initially? It seems like the knee is the primary issue at the moment, with the previous ankle involvement being relatively short-lived. Does that fit the typical pattern? Also, should we consider adding any other tests at this point, perhaps to rule out other inflammatory arthropathies like psoriatic arthritis or even an early spondyloarthropathy, especially if the NAAT and Lyme tests come back negative? While the patient doesn't have any skin changes suggestive of psoriasis, I'd like to be thorough. Finally, what's your recommendation for follow-up? Should the patient be seen again in a week,"

Two quick follow-up questions: 1. Regarding the HLA-B27 testing, should we wait to see the response to antibiotics before ordering that test? If the patient responds well to the Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin, does that essentially confirm the DGI diagnosis and make HLA-B27 testing less relevant? 2. You mentioned following up in 1-2 weeks.

My primary concern, given the mucus and sense of incomplete evacuation, was initially inflammatory bowel disease, but the negative calprotectin and lack of blood make that less likely.

Also, while the patient denies any specific food triggers, have you found that a low FODMAP diet trial is helpful in cases like this, even in the absence of clear identifiable triggers?

My primary differential diagnosis at this point is ovarian cancer, despite the normal CA-125. We know that CA-125 isn't always elevated in ovarian cancer, particularly in earlier stages or certain histological subtypes. Other possibilities on the differential include a benign ovarian tumor with secondary ascites, or a non-gynecological cause of ascites such as heart failure, liver disease, or infection. However,"

These additional tumor markers will provide a more comprehensive picture, especially given the normal CA-125. The paracentesis with cytology is essential, as you mentioned, to determine if malignant cells are present in the ascitic fluid. This will be the most definitive way to confirm or rule out malignancy at this stage. Before referring to gynecologic oncology, I was wondering if we should consider any imaging beyond the ultrasound, such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis? This might help to better characterize the mass itself, assess the extent of the ascites, and identify any potential metastatic spread, which would inform surgical planning if needed. Also, given the patient's shortness of breath, particularly with exertion and while lying down, I'm slightly concerned about the potential for pleural effusions as well. Would you recommend a chest X-"

I'll also schedule the paracentesis and the additional tumor marker tests (HE4, CEA, and CA 72-4) today. Before I finalize the referral to gynecologic oncology, I wanted to clarify one point. Given the patient's relatively young age (assuming she is pre-menopausal based on the mention of menstrual irregularities), and the normal CA-125, should we consider other, less common differentials, such as a Meigs\u2019 syndrome or a struma ovarii, even though these are typically associated with markedly elevated CA-125 levels? I understand these are less likely, but I want to ensure we're considering all possibilities. Also, are there any specific genetic tests you'd recommend at this stage"

I'll also ensure the CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, chest x-ray, and the HE4, CEA, and CA 72-4 tests are completed urgently. Just to clarify regarding the paracentesis, besides cytology, are there any other specific analyses of the ascitic fluid you'd recommend, such as flow cytometry, protein levels, or other markers? This might help further differentiate between malignant and benign causes, particularly if the cytology is inconclusive. While we await the Gyn Onc appointment, should we initiate any empiric treatment for symptom management, specifically the patient's shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort? For example, would a short course of diuretics be appropriate to manage the ascites and potentially alleviate her respiratory symptoms, or should we defer any such interventions until after consultation with Gyn Onc?"

Just one final question to ensure I've covered all bases: given the patient's irregular and slightly heavier periods, while we suspect the ovarian mass is the primary issue, should we also consider adding a pelvic MRI to the imaging workup? While the CT will provide excellent information regarding the mass and potential spread, an MRI might offer additional detail regarding the uterine lining and rule out any concurrent uterine pathology contributing to the menstrual changes, even if it's less likely."

A Gynecologic Oncologist specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system and is the most qualified to diagnose and manage potential ovarian malignancies. Even with a normal CA-125, the other symptoms and ultrasound findings warrant expert evaluation by this specialist."
