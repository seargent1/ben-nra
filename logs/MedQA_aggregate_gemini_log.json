I strongly suspect myasthenia gravis (MG) given the patient's presentation of fluctuating proximal muscle weakness, diplopia worse on lateral and upward gaze, and positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The EMG showing decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation further supports this. I'm concerned that the NCS wasn't performed, as it could help differentiate between a presynaptic and postsynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder, although the antibody test makes MG highly probable. My main questions for you are: 1. Do you concur with the likely diagnosis of MG? 2. What's your opinion on the significance of the NCS not being performed at this stage? Is it crucial to obtain before initiating treatment? 3. Given the patient's report of mild dyspnea on exertion, what baseline respiratory function tests would you recommend to assess the risk of a myasthenic crisis?

A few more questions: 1. Given the patient's relatively mild symptoms at this point, would you recommend starting with pyridostigmine alone, or would you consider adding a steroid like prednisone early on? I'm leaning towards pyridostigmine initially, but I'm open to your perspective. 2. The patient reported some blurry vision in addition to diplopia. While this could be related to the extraocular muscle weakness, should we consider further ophthalmological evaluation to rule out any other contributing factors? 3. Regarding the thymoma, if the CT scan reveals a thymoma, would you recommend thymectomy regardless of its size or histological features, or would you adopt a more selective approach based on those factors? 4."

Regarding the thymectomy, I understand it's generally recommended, but I'm curious about your threshold for recommending it in a patient with a small, non-invasive thymoma. Are there specific histological subtypes where you might favor a watch-and-wait approach, particularly in an older patient or someone with comorbidities that might increase surgical risk? Also, while we're discussing treatment options, what are your thoughts on the potential role of other immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, in this patient?

Given her age and relatively mild symptoms, I'm inclined to start with pyridostigmine and closely monitor her response. If we do need to add prednisone, I'd prefer to keep the dose as low as possible to minimize the risk of steroid-related side effects, especially given her hypertension. Would you generally agree with that approach? Also, I'm curious about your thoughts on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange.

What is your typical approach to managing these patients, particularly regarding the discontinuation of natalizumab and potential plasma exchange?

For example, if the first PCR is negative and the patient experiences a sudden worsening of ataxia or develops new focal weakness, would you advocate for biopsy at that point, or would you still prefer to obtain a second lumbar puncture for JC virus PCR before proceeding to biopsy?

He's refusing his formula, which he usually takes readily, and his intake has decreased by about 50%. The distension is constant and painful to the touch. He appears hungry but cries and refuses the bottle, seemingly associating it with the discomfort. He's fussy and irritable, but I haven't observed any fever or lethargy. Crucially, the abdominal X-ray shows dilated bowel segments and an absence of gas in the rectum, raising strong suspicion of an obstruction. My primary concern is some form of mechanical obstruction, possibly intussusception given his age. I've been trying to ascertain if he's passed any stool since the onset of symptoms, and whether the vomiting, if any, has been projectile, which would further support intussusception."

I haven't been able to get a definitive answer about currant jelly stools yet, as the parent was understandably overwhelmed. I did ask about the nature of any vomiting and stool passage, but the focus was on getting him stabilized and transported. I agree that its absence doesn't rule out intussusception. Beyond intussusception, what other differentials are you considering given the dilated bowel and lack of rectal gas? Could this presentation be consistent with Hirschsprung's disease, or is the acute onset against that? I also briefly considered malrotation with volvulus, though I didn't elicit a history"

Should we consider pyloric stenosis in the differential? While the typical presentation is projectile vomiting, the forceful contractions against a pyloric obstruction could theoretically lead to some degree of bowel distension proximal to the obstruction, though I'd expect more prominent vomiting. Also, the onset at 8 months is a bit later than typical. What are your thoughts on that?

While less frequent than intussusception or malrotation, they can present similarly with obstruction. Is there anything in this presentation that makes you think those are more or less likely? Should the ER team consider these possibilities if the initial workup for intussusception and malrotation is negative?

I'm slightly concerned about delaying the pulmonary workup if his dyspnea is related to airway compression from the mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but I think the PET scan will give us a better picture of the extent of involvement and help guide any urgent interventions. Should we consider a baseline ABG along with the PFTs to assess his oxygenation status and look for any signs of respiratory compromise? Also, given his significant smoking history and the possibility of underlying lung disease, would you recommend a chest CT with contrast to better visualize the lung parenchyma and assess for any masses or other abnormalities that might not be clearly visible on the initial non-contrast CT?"

Once we have the flow cytometry results, are there any specific immunophenotypic markers or genetic abnormalities we should be looking for that might influence treatment decisions or prognosis, beyond confirming the DLBCL classification?

The patient described the pain as being just below the kneecap on the medial side. While this is consistent with an MCL sprain, could this location also suggest a medial meniscus tear, or is the location slightly too high for that? I'm trying to gauge the likelihood of a combined injury. 2. The patient reported feeling some instability, particularly with turning. Did you glean any information from the history that suggests a complete versus partial MCL tear? Would the degree of instability influence the decision to obtain an MRI sooner rather than later? 3.

For example, would a positive valgus stress test at 30 degrees of flexion be sufficient, or would you be looking for more laxity than that?

While the absence of warmth and swelling argues against a significant inflammatory process, could the patient's PCOS and birth control use potentially exacerbate a low-grade inflammatory response in the setting of an MCL sprain?

His history points towards potential triggers like dehydration, poor sleep, and high stress.

Are there any other cardiac causes we should consider given the seemingly benign initial workup? Should we consider a tilt table test to confirm the diagnosis?

Just to confirm my understanding, if the Holter shows only infrequent, isolated PVCs or NSVT with no correlation to the reported syncope, and no pauses or bradyarrhythmias, we would likely continue with the conservative management plan and not proceed directly to a tilt table test, correct? I want to ensure we're not over-investigating in the absence of more concerning findings.

I appreciate you mentioning cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) and generalized essential telangiectasia.

Generalized essential telangiectasia is also rare in newborns. Given the potential for serious consequences with a missed diagnosis, I want to be as thorough as possible. While the spots being described don't sound like petechiae or purpura in the classic sense, I still think we need to consider conditions that can cause them, especially given the potential for coagulopathy. 1.

Most of the vascular lesions we've discussed present with blanching or at least some change in color with pressure, which the mother specifically denied. 1.

I'm strongly suspecting postpartum endometritis given the patient's fever of 102\u00b0F, lower abdominal tenderness, heavy vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus, lower back pain, night sweats, and recent vaginal delivery of a large infant. The prolonged labor mentioned also increases the risk. While we're waiting on the CBC, urinalysis, and blood culture results, I've scheduled her for a pelvic exam tomorrow afternoon. My primary differential diagnosis is endometritis, but I want to consider other possibilities. Do you think we should also consider pelvic thrombophlebitis, given the lower back pain and potential for increased clotting postpartum? Also, while she denies dysuria, could a UTI still be contributing to the fever and potentially exacerbating the uterine infection? Finally, given the decreased bowel sounds and reported constipation, could we be seeing some localized peritonitis or paralytic ileus secondary to the potential infection?"

Given the patient's history of delivering a large infant, I'm wondering if we should also consider postpartum hemorrhage as a contributing factor to her current symptoms, even though her bleeding is described as \"a bit heavier\" rather than dramatically so. Could the combination of a large baby and prolonged labor have caused uterine atony that's contributing to both the bleeding and increased risk of infection? Should we be prepared to administer uterotonics like oxytocin during the exam if the uterus feels boggy or enlarged? Finally, while endometritis seems most likely, I want to ensure we're considering less common postpartum infections.

Are there any specific lab tests beyond the CBC, urinalysis, and blood cultures already ordered that you would recommend to help distinguish between these diagnoses, such as a D-dimer or lactate level?

My primary differential diagnosis includes: 1. **Rectal Cancer:** The patient's age isn't specified, but the family history, palpable mass, and bleeding make this a top concern. The reported growth of the mass is also worrisome. 2. **Hemorrhoids:** While the patient denies a history of hemorrhoids, they can develop quickly.

The aura of a \"dirt/mud\" taste is highly suggestive of gustatory hallucinations, a classic TLE symptom. The reported automatisms (hand movements), head turning, upward eye deviation, and post-ictal confusion further support this. The normal MRI is also consistent with TLE, as structural abnormalities are not always present. However, I have a few questions and thoughts before we definitively conclude on TLE. 1. Could you elaborate on the description of the \"dreamlike\" feeling the patient experiences before the episodes? This could be an aura, but I'd like to understand its nature more fully.

I agree that a sleep-deprived EEG is a good next step to increase the sensitivity of the test. Beyond that, I'd like to consider a few other things: 1. **Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):** While the EEG findings and aura are strongly suggestive of TLE, PNES should remain in the differential, especially given the dreamlike state described. Could we explore further the patient's psychological history and current stressors? A psychiatric evaluation might be helpful to differentiate. Sometimes, PNES and epilepsy can co-exist, adding complexity. 2. **Migraine with Aura:** While the typical migraine aura is visual, some patients experience sensory or even cognitive auras."

While less likely given the EEG findings, it could point us towards other differentials like a low-grade glioma or other lesions not readily apparent on MRI. Beyond the CT, I'm still somewhat concerned about the possibility of PNES, even alongside TLE. The dreamlike aura, while potentially fitting with TLE, also overlaps with dissociative symptoms. I think a psychiatric evaluation, alongside the seizure diary, could help clarify this. Specifically, exploring any history of trauma, significant stressors, or other psychiatric diagnoses would be informative.

I'm particularly interested in the potential overlap between TLE and PNES. While the gustatory aura and other features strongly point towards TLE, the dreamlike state and the somewhat vague description of the aura still leave room for PNES, or even a combination of both. Therefore, during the psych evaluation, I'll specifically ask about: 1. **Dissociation:** We need to clarify the nature of this \"dreamlike\" feeling. Does the patient feel detached from their body or surroundings? Do they experience alterations in perception of time? This will help distinguish between a true aura and a dissociative experience. 2"

I'm still circling back to the somewhat atypical nature of the aura. While a gustatory aura is classic for TLE, the \"dirt/mud\" description, while not unheard of, is less common than metallic or burnt tastes.

Did the contrast enema show a normal ligament of Treitz? Also, has the infant experienced any episodes where the vomiting is particularly forceful or projectile? This could further point towards volvulus. Finally, while the mother reported an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, were there any prenatal ultrasounds performed that might have incidentally noted the intestinal positioning?

I haven't been able to locate any prenatal ultrasound records yet, but I'm continuing to search for those. Regarding the ligament of Treitz, it appeared to be in a normal position on the contrast enema, but given the other findings, I'm concerned that this might be a case of intermittent volvulus where the bowel has temporarily returned to a more normal position.

Is it possible the radiologist missed a subtle sign of malrotation, especially given the potential corkscrew sign I noted on re-review?

We have a patient presenting with acute onset pain and swelling in the right ring finger DIP joint following a hyperextension injury during a football game two days prior. The pain is described as sharp and throbbing, currently a 7/10, localized to the DIP joint with some swelling extending to the rest of the finger. He has limited range of motion and difficulty making a fist due to the pain. There's no numbness or tingling, and elevation doesn't provide relief. The finger is warm to the touch with some redness, but no bruising. Importantly, the x-ray is negative for fracture or dislocation. My primary differential diagnosis at this point includes a mallet finger, volar plate injury, or a soft tissue injury like a sprain or contusion. Given the mechanism of injury and the location of the pain and swelling, I'm leaning towards a mallet finger or volar plate injury."

It could also provide more detail regarding the volar plate and surrounding soft tissues. Before considering an MRI, I'd like to clarify a few things. Did the patient report any popping or clicking sensation at the time of injury? This could suggest a volar plate injury or even an avulsion fracture.

Given the patient is already on levofloxacin for pneumonia, are there any potential drug interactions we should be aware of with vancomycin? Although unlikely, I want to be sure we're not exacerbating any potential QT prolongation risk. 2. Should we consider adding probiotics alongside the vancomycin? Some studies suggest they might help prevent recurrence of *C. difficile*, but I'm unsure of the current best practice. 3.

My main differential diagnoses at this point are: * **Placental abruption:** This is my primary concern given the classic presentation. * **Uterine rupture:** While less likely given she's a primigravida (we need to confirm this), it can present similarly with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Her description of a \"tearing\" sensation raises this possibility slightly. * **Vasa previa:** This is less likely given the severity of the bleeding and pain.

While the bleeding pattern seems more consistent with an abruption, I want to make sure we're covering all bases. Also"

I'm strongly suspecting CMV retinitis given the patient's presentation, medical history of AIDS with a low CD4 count (36/mm3), the recent onset of floaters, blurred vision described as a \"dark shade,\" worsening night vision, and the absence of pain. The funduscopic findings of granular yellow-white opacities around retinal vessels and dot-blot hemorrhages further solidify this diagnosis. My main concern now is the extent of retinal involvement and the potential for vision loss. I've already initiated intravenous antiviral therapy. My questions for you are: 1. Based on your expertise and the funduscopy findings, what is your assessment of the severity of the retinitis? Is there evidence of macular involvement or involvement of the optic nerve? 2. Are there any other ophthalmologic tests you recommend at this stage, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or fluorescein angiography"

I'm particularly concerned about macular involvement given the patient's description of a \"dark shade\" over his vision. While the funduscopy suggests moderate retinitis, the subjective visual disturbance seems more significant. Could the \"dark shade\" description indicate something beyond the observed opacities and hemorrhages? Could there be subtle macular edema not readily apparent on funduscopy, or perhaps early ischemic changes? Would you consider adding an electroretinogram (ERG) to assess retinal function, especially given the reported difficulty with night vision? Regarding the fluorescein angiography, while I understand it's less urgent, I'm leaning towards performing it sooner rather than later. Given the patient's low CD4 count and the potential for rapid progression, I'd prefer to have a complete picture of the retinal vasculature and any areas of ischemia"

While we're focusing on the retinitis, could these systemic symptoms be contributing to his overall visual disturbance? Should we consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist for a broader systemic evaluation? Also, regarding the ERG, are there specific parameters or protocols you recommend given the suspicion of CMV retinitis and the night vision complaint? Should we focus on scotopic responses, or is a full-field ERG more appropriate in this case?

I'm wondering if this might provide additional information regarding the severity of retinal involvement, especially in the periphery. 2. **Regarding alternative/adjunctive therapies:** Once the patient is stabilized, I'd be interested in discussing the potential role of intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet.

While the negative Chlamydia and Gonorrhea tests are helpful, they don't rule out reactive arthritis, especially given the patient's sexual history and the classic triad of symptoms. The absence of GI symptoms is somewhat atypical, but not unheard of in reactive arthritis. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is reactive arthritis, likely triggered by a non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial infection. Given the negative gram stain and culture of the synovial fluid, septic arthritis seems less likely, but I wouldn't entirely rule it out yet pending the results of the synovial fluid culture.

Given the patient's recent sexual history, even with negative chlamydia and gonorrhea tests, could we consider additional STI testing, such as for Mycoplasma genitalium or Trichomonas vaginalis? While less common triggers for reactive arthritis, they could be contributing to the urethritis and potentially the overall inflammatory picture. 2.

A few more questions: Did the patient mention any specific location of the abdominal discomfort? Is it generalized or localized to a particular quadrant? Also, what about the frequency of the diarrhea? Is it several times a day, or more clustered? This might help differentiate further. Finally, regarding the camping trip, did they mention any details about water sources they used? This information could be relevant if we're pursuing a parasitic cause. I agree that the colonoscopy with biopsies will be crucial, especially to differentiate between IBS and microscopic colitis. Should we also consider a flexible sigmoidoscopy as a less invasive first step, or go straight to colonoscopy given the duration of symptoms?"

Would you include that in the initial workup, or wait for the colonoscopy results? Also, given the patient's age (which I should have mentioned earlier - they are 45 years old), what is your preferred approach to bowel prep for the colonoscopy? Are there any specific considerations for patients with chronic diarrhea when choosing a prep regimen?

While a colonoscopy is planned, it might be helpful to have this baseline data. Also, regarding the potential for microscopic colitis, are there any specific histological features we should be looking for during the colonoscopy besides the lymphocytic or collagenous infiltration?

The diarrhea is frequent, occurring multiple times a day, often after meals. Regarding the camping trip, the patient recalls using a stream for drinking water, although they did use a purification tablet. This reinforces the possibility of a parasitic infection, even with the purification attempt.

She denies chest pain but reports chest tightness and difficulty taking a deep breath, exacerbated by exertion and recumbency. She also describes a sensation of abdominal fullness and pressure. Importantly, she denies any changes in bowel or urinary habits, or vaginal bleeding. She has a known ovarian mass, described as \"large and complex\" on a recent ultrasound performed three weeks ago. I'm concerned about malignant ovarian cancer with possible malignant pleural effusion causing her respiratory symptoms. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is ovarian cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and pleural effusion. The progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and increasing abdominal girth, in conjunction with the known ovarian mass, strongly suggest this. The \"large and complex\" description of the mass raises further suspicion. Other possibilities to consider, though less likely given"

I also concur with a diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, given her significant respiratory distress. While ovarian cancer seems most likely, I'd like to explore a few points to refine our understanding. First, do we have any information regarding the patient's age and family history of cancer, particularly ovarian or breast cancer? This information could influence our risk stratification. Second, the ultrasound report mentioned a \"complex\" ovarian mass. Do we have access to the full report, including details about the size, characteristics of the mass (solid, cystic, mixed), presence of septations, or any vascularity findings? Knowing these specifics could further support the suspicion of malignancy. Third, while she denies any weight change, has she noticed any changes in her appetite or early satiety? These can be subtle signs of advanced malignancy."

I'll also retrieve the full ultrasound report to review the specific characteristics of the ovarian mass. In addition to fatigue and night sweats, I'll also ask about any unexplained weight loss, as she mentioned no significant change but hasn't specifically quantified it. Given the possibility of a malignant pleural effusion contributing to her dyspnea, I think a thoracentesis should be prioritized alongside the paracentesis. This will allow us to analyze the pleural fluid for malignant cells and provide more immediate symptomatic relief. While we're highly suspicious of ovarian cancer, considering her relatively young age (assuming she's of student age based on her mentioning stairs at school), we should also keep in mind less common diagnoses, albeit less probable. Could the complex ovarian mass be a benign entity like a dermoid cyst or a benign cystic"

Regarding Meigs' syndrome, while the pleural effusion fits, the ascites and ovarian mass typically resolve with removal of the tumor, and her symptoms have been progressive over a month. This makes a rapidly growing malignant process more likely. To further differentiate Meigs' from malignancy, I'll specifically ask about the presence of hydrothorax, which is more characteristic of Meigs'. Also, while a benign process is possible, the \"complex\" nature of the mass on the prior ultrasound makes it less probable. I'll ensure we get a copy of that report as soon as possible. Beyond Meigs', are there any other benign differentials we should consider given the complex ovarian mass and ascites? A large, complex hemorrhagic cyst, perhaps? Or a benign tumor with secondary complications?"

I'm particularly interested in the HE4, as it can be helpful in differentiating benign from malignant ovarian masses, especially in conjunction with CA-125. Before we conclude and await the imaging and fluid analyses, I want to clarify a few points and suggest a couple of additional considerations. First, regarding the hemorrhagic cyst, did the previous ultrasound report mention any features suggestive of hemorrhage, such as fluid-fluid levels or internal echoes? This could help support or refute that possibility. Second, while we've discussed benign tumors, could we be dealing with a borderline ovarian tumor?
