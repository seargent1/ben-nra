I\u2019m strongly suspecting exogenous ochronosis given the patient's history of long-term hydroquinone use, the bluish-brown patches on her face, the burning sensation, and the confirmatory biopsy results showing the characteristic banana-shaped pigment deposits. While the initial improvement of her melasma with hydroquinone makes sense, the subsequent development of ochronosis is a known complication, especially with prolonged use. My main question now revolves around management. While discontinuing the hydroquinone is obviously the first step, I'm curious about your experience with other treatment modalities for exogenous ochronosis. Have you had success with topical retinoids, chemical peels, or laser therapies like Q-switched ruby or Nd:YAG lasers in your practice? I'm also wondering about the patient's prognosis. Is complete resolution of the hyperpigmentation realistic, or should we focus on managing expectations and aiming for improvement rather than a complete"

Would a lower concentration of topical retinoid be advisable initially, given the reported burning sensation with other topical products? 2. In your experience, what's the typical timeframe for seeing noticeable improvement with this combination approach? This will help me manage the patient's expectations effectively. 3. Are there any specific contraindications or precautions we should be aware of when using these therapies in combination?

Just a couple of final points for clarification: 1. Regarding the frequency of the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser treatments, you mentioned \"every few months.\" Could you be a bit more specific?

I'm thinking specifically of medications that might exacerbate or mimic ochronosis. 2. In terms of monitoring the patient's progress, besides visual assessment of the pigmentation, are there any other objective measures you recommend, such as dermoscopy or repeat biopsies at specific intervals? 3.

Secondly, given the crazy paving pattern on the chest x-ray, I'm slightly concerned about other interstitial lung diseases, albeit less likely. Would you consider including a discussion of other ILDs, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, in the differential, even if sarcoidosis"

Given the potential for other ILDs, and to further refine our diagnostic approach, I wanted to discuss a few additional points. Firstly, regarding the patient's environment, were there any specific questions about potential exposures that you think would be helpful to ask? I asked about the usual culprits like dust, mold, and pets, but perhaps there are other less common exposures relevant to hypersensitivity pneumonitis that we should explore. Secondly, would you recommend any specific serological tests beyond the ACE and calcium levels already mentioned? For instance, would an ANA or rheumatoid factor be helpful in this context, even with no other suggestive symptoms of connective tissue disease?

One more question regarding the biopsy: Given the possibility of NSIP, would you recommend obtaining a surgical lung biopsy if the transbronchial biopsy is non-diagnostic or inconclusive? I'm weighing the benefits of a definitive diagnosis against the increased risk associated with a surgical procedure.

Regarding age, are there any specific age ranges or thresholds that would significantly alter your differential diagnosis or preferred investigative approach? For example, would a patient in their 20s with this presentation raise any different concerns compared to a patient in their 60s? You mentioned not starting empiric corticosteroids before biopsy confirmation. I agree in this case, especially given the possibility of fungal infections which could be exacerbated by steroids.

Firstly, given the patient's initial presentation mimicking a more common infection or autoimmune condition, and the rarity of IVLBCL, I'm wondering if we should consider any additional testing to definitively rule out other potential contributing factors. While the biopsy is fairly conclusive, the initial normal blood work (aside from the LDH) and the patient's description of the skin lesions make me want to be absolutely certain. Could we consider a repeat skin biopsy specifically targeting one of the ulcerated lesions for further histopathological examination and perhaps additional immunophenotyping?

However, the patient also reports a history of working with asbestos insulation, raising the possibility of asbestosis or other asbestos-related pulmonary disease contributing to their respiratory symptoms. My initial differential diagnosis includes: 1. **Constrictive Pericarditis:** The pericardial calcification and symptoms of right-sided heart failure (peripheral edema, bloating) strongly suggest this. 2. **Asbestosis:** The occupational history and reported crackling sound on inspiration raise this possibility. 3. **Pleural plaques/thickening:** While not directly causing the patient"

If the echo suggests constriction, the cardiac MRI can then provide a more definitive assessment of pericardial thickness and look for any subtle signs we might have missed.

The 4mm pericardial thickening threshold on CMR is helpful guidance. A couple of further questions come to mind: 1. Given the patient's history of asbestos exposure, should we consider mesothelioma as part of the differential, even though the current presentation seems more aligned with constrictive pericarditis?

Given the monoclonal gammopathy, I'm also considering serum free light chain assay and a repeat SPEP with immunofixation in 3 months to monitor for any progression. My main concern with leaning so heavily towards dcSSc is the lack of significant systemic involvement so far. The patient denies any gastrointestinal issues, lung involvement, or significant weight loss. While these can develop later, her skin involvement has been present for three years already. Could this be a more localized form of scleroderma, like morphea, with overlapping Raynaud's phenomenon and a coincidental monoclonal gammopathy? Also,"

My primary concern now is the possibility of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation despite the negative tests, presenting atypically.

Could the patient's symptoms also be indicative of Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS)? The facial nerve is involved in RHS, and while the rash is typically around the ear, could a variant presentation involve the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and mimic some aspects of HZO? Also, given the reported numbness and slight blurring of vision, could we be looking at something like a compressive neuropathy affecting both the trigeminal and optic nerves? Perhaps an MRI of the brain and orbits would be helpful to rule out any structural abnormalities or lesions in the area. What are your thoughts on these possibilities"

Could a variant presentation of RHS, perhaps with unusual viral spread, explain this atypical distribution? Regarding the compressive neuropathy, while less likely, I'm leaning towards ordering the MRI brain/orbits for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it will definitively rule out any structural causes for the patient's symptoms. Secondly, even if HZO is confirmed, the MRI could help assess the extent of any inflammation or potential complications affecting the nerves or surrounding tissues.

It started near the spine and wrapped around towards the chest, which isn't the typical pattern for HZO. Even with atypical presentations, this seems unusual. I'm also curious about the patient's report of the rash getting progressively larger. Does HZO typically exhibit this kind of expansion over several months?

Initially, the productive cough, fever, chills, night sweats, and weight loss pointed towards pneumonia, possibly even tuberculosis. However, the sputum culture came back negative, and the chest x-ray, while showing consolidations, reveals a pattern more peripheral and subpleural, sparing the perihilar region, which is somewhat atypical for typical bacterial pneumonia. The most striking finding is the pronounced hypereosinophilia on the CBC. This, combined with the negative sputum culture and the x-ray findings, shifts the differential significantly. My primary concern now is a process involving eosinophilic lung disease. Given the subacute presentation and the upper lobe predominance on the x-ray, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is high on my list. Although we've ruled out common infectious causes, the recent upper respiratory symptoms in the grandchildren raise the possibility of an atypical infection triggering an eosinophilic response, although this is"

Bronchoscopy with lavage is a good consideration as well. While the sputum culture was negative, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) might offer a higher diagnostic yield, especially if we're dealing with a non-infectious process. It could also help rule out other less common possibilities like eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), although the lack of upper airway or sinus involvement makes that less likely.

The primary care physician suspects entropion with secondary exposure keratitis, potentially contributing to the blurry vision. My main concern is the blurry vision coupled with the dulling of colors.

If the cold agglutinin titer comes back positive, but with a low titer, could that explain the lack of acrocyanosis or Raynaud's? Essentially, could this be a mild form of CAD? Also, while less likely, I'd like to briefly consider other potential contributors to the"

Given the patient's age (which I haven't explicitly stated but should have included in the initial presentation - let's assume they are middle-aged), I'd also like to consider the possibility of an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, even if the cold agglutinin studies are positive.

Given the negative cytology, carcinoma in situ (CIS) is less likely, but absolutely needs to be ruled out. Should we consider any other parasitic infections besides Schistosomiasis, given the eosinophilia? Something like Strongyloidiasis, perhaps, even though it's more associated with GI symptoms?

He reports rinsing his mouth after each use, which should mitigate the risk, yet he still developed laryngeal candidiasis. He also mentioned dry mouth, which could further contribute to the fungal overgrowth. My primary concern is ruling out any underlying immunodeficiency, even though he denies any other signs or symptoms suggestive of this. While his COPD is a chronic condition, it doesn't typically predispose to this type of infection to this degree, especially with adherence to preventative measures like rinsing. My questions for you are: 1. Given the seemingly localized nature of the candidiasis (larynx, with dry mouth), what further investigations, if any,"

Could the inhaled steroid itself be exacerbating the dry mouth, even with rinsing? Are there any other potential causes we should consider, such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, although he doesn't have other typical symptoms?

We have a male patient with HIV, well-controlled on ART for five years, who developed recurrent, painful genital ulcers about a year ago. The ulcers are cyclical, occurring roughly monthly, resolve spontaneously, and then recur. They appeared *after* he was already on stable ART. Biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation, and initial syphilis and HSV testing wasn't done, though I've requested repeat testing along with bacterial and viral cultures from the ulcers themselves. He denies any recent travel, trauma, or association with shaving. The cyclical nature is throwing me off. My primary differential at this point, despite the negative biopsy, still includes HSV. It's possible the initial biopsy missed the diagnostic changes, or perhaps the ulcers represent a less typical presentation due to his immunocompromised state. Syphilis remains a possibility, though less likely given the chronicity and recurrence pattern. Chanc"

Could the genital ulcers be the *only* presenting symptom of Beh\u00e7et's, especially in an HIV-positive patient? Regarding drug reactions, he's only on ART, which he's been taking for five years. The ulcers only started a year ago, making a drug reaction less probable, as you mentioned. I'm also wondering about other, less common STIs. Could this be lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)? Or perhaps granuloma inguinale (Donovanosis)? Although, I believe those typically present with different ulcer characteristics. I'll also ask"

Even a brief interruption and re-challenge could theoretically cause a fixed drug eruption at the same site. I'm still somewhat perplexed by the strict periodicity of the ulcers. Is there anything else that follows a monthly cycle that could be relevant? Does he receive any intramuscular injections, for example, long-acting ART formulations or other medications? Could there be a localized reaction at the injection site, even if it's not in the genital area, that somehow triggers the genital ulcers? I know it's"

If they are truly fixed, that would strongly point towards a fixed drug eruption or contact dermatitis, as you mentioned. That said, if it *is* a fixed drug eruption related to his ART, wouldn't we expect the eruptions to occur more frequently than once a month, given that he's taking the medication daily? Is it possible for a fixed drug eruption to manifest with such a delayed and cyclical pattern?
