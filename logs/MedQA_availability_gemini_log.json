Notably, there are no reported muscle fasciculations, spasms, dysphagia, dysarthria, or changes in facial expression. The patient denies any family history of neuromuscular disorders, recent illnesses, infections, tick bites, or use of unusual medications, supplements, or herbal remedies. My primary concern is **myasthenia gravis (MG)**.

I haven't specifically asked about recent vaccinations or toxin exposure, but the patient denied any recent illnesses or unusual medications/supplements. I'll add those specific questions to the next visit. However, the absence of autonomic symptoms like dry mouth or constipation makes LEMS less likely in my view. Botulism seems less probable given the gradual onset over a month, rather than the acute presentation we typically see. The fatigability and prominent ocular symptoms still favor MG. To further differentiate, I think serological testing for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies is warranted. Would you agree? Also, an electromyography (EMG) with repetitive nerve stimulation could be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing between MG, LEMS, and other neuromuscular disorders. What are your thoughts on the utility of a single-fiber EMG in this case? Finally"

I'll also order thyroid function tests as you suggested, to rule out any thyroid-related myopathy contributing to the symptoms. While I still strongly suspect MG, the point about thyroid dysfunction is well-taken. Could hypothyroidism also explain the patient's fatigue and proximal muscle weakness? I'm curious to know your thoughts on the likelihood of Graves' disease mimicking MG, given the presence of ptosis. Although the patient doesn't report other typical Graves' symptoms like heat intolerance or palpitations, I think it's worth considering. Regarding the single-fiber EMG, I understand its utility in cases of suspected MG with negative initial serology.

One question I have \u2013 given the patient's age (I'm assuming adult, though this wasn't explicitly stated), what's your experience with the likelihood of MuSK-positive MG versus AChR-positive MG?

Regarding mitochondrial myopathies, what specific features in this presentation would suggest this diagnosis? I understand they can cause muscle weakness and fatigue, but the fluctuating nature of this patient's symptoms, the prominent ocular involvement, and the improvement with rest seem less characteristic of mitochondrial disorders, in my experience. Would you recommend any specific investigations for mitochondrial myopathy at this stage, or would you suggest pursuing those only if the initial workup for MG is negative?

While the MRI is highly suggestive of PML, I'd like to discuss a few points. First, the speed of progression is notable. While PML can progress rapidly, this seems particularly fast, even with natalizumab. I'm wondering if there are any other contributing factors we should consider. Were there any atypical findings on the MRI, such as unusual lesion location or enhancement patterns, that might suggest a concurrent process?

While reviewing the patient's history, I noticed they mentioned their Crohn's has been \"pretty aggressive.\" This raises a question in my mind: could the patient's immunosuppressed state due to the Crohn's itself, in combination with the natalizumab, be contributing to the rapid progression of PML?

Given the patient's Crohn's disease and the possibility of an already compromised immune system, I'm also wondering if we should consider other opportunistic infections, even though the presentation strongly suggests PML.

However, I'd like to rule out other potential causes of bowel obstruction such as meconium ileus equivalent (though less likely at this age), anorectal malformation, or"

My understanding is that while meconium plugs can occur in Hirschsprung's, they are more commonly associated with cystic fibrosis, which we should also consider, though the normal weight gain makes CF less likely. Given the current presentation, how likely do you think it is that the contrast enema will be therapeutic in relieving the obstruction, or will it primarily be diagnostic? Also, should we be considering any other diagnostic tests at this point, such as anorectal manometry, to further evaluate the possibility of Hirschsprung's or other motility disorders?

Beyond lymphoma, what other GI processes could potentially explain these findings? The patient's normal endoscopy and colonoscopy make inflammatory bowel disease less likely, but could we be dealing with something like celiac disease, despite the lack of classic GI symptoms?"

While many of the tests came back normal, the initial presentation of fatigue, abdominal pain, night sweats, weight loss, and *especially* the enlarged supraclavicular lymph node are highly suspicious for lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting the lymphatic system. The initial blood work showing elevated WBCs and LDH further supports this. Even the confirmed finding of lymphocytes with a high proliferative index staining positive for CD20 from the cervical lymph node biopsy strongly points to lymphoma (specifically Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma or DLBCL). Although subsequent tests like the PET/CT and bone marrow biopsy were normal, these don't definitively rule out lymphoma. Lymphomas can sometimes be difficult to stage or detect with standard imaging, and false negatives can occur.

Given the lack of prodromal symptoms besides the lightheadedness, and the very brief duration of the event, I'm leaning towards a neurally mediated mechanism like vasovagal or situational syncope. However, I agree that orthostatic hypotension needs to be ruled out. Could we arrange for an orthostatic blood pressure measurement to be taken? Also, while his ECG was normal, could we consider a 48-hour Holter monitor to capture any intermittent arrhythmias that might have been missed?

He claims to drink six to seven glasses of water a day, which seems adequate, but could this still be a form of situational dehydration contributing to the orthostatic hypotension, even with seemingly normal hydration habits?

She also notes brownish lochia, which while expected postpartum, could be indicative of infection given the other symptoms. She denies dysuria but reports urinary frequency. Importantly, she denies chills and any redness or swelling in the perineal area. My primary concern is postpartum endometritis. The fever, lower abdominal pain, and brownish lochia all point towards this diagnosis. The prolonged labor and large infant increase the risk of infection. The absence of perineal redness or swelling suggests the infection is likely within the uterus rather than a localized perineal infection.

Regarding post-reduction immobilization, a hip brace seems preferable to a spica cast, particularly for patient comfort and hygiene. However, I'd like your opinion on the degree of stability required to opt for a brace versus a cast. If there's a subtle, non-displaced posterior wall fracture, would you still consider a brace sufficient, or would you lean towards a spica cast for added stability?

Regarding weight-bearing, I'm a bit more cautious about early weight-bearing, even protected, in the presence of a posterior wall fracture. While I understand the benefits of early mobilization, I'm concerned about the risk of fracture displacement or propagation. Would you consider delaying weight-bearing for a slightly longer period, say 4-6 weeks, if a posterior wall fracture is confirmed on the repeat CT, even if it's non-displaced?

This will help guide fluid management intraoperatively and postoperatively. Also, while the mother initially reported no family history of relevant conditions, she needs to double-check her records for any mention of intestinal abnormalities on prenatal ultrasounds. While unlikely at this stage, a negative finding for malrotation on the upper GI shouldn't completely rule it out, and the ultrasound might offer additional clues.

Regarding the repeat x-ray, would you recommend a standard x-ray or would a specific view, like a lateral stress view, be more beneficial in identifying a potential occult or small avulsion fracture that might be missed on the initial x-ray? 2. You mentioned 6-8 weeks for healing. Is that the typical timeframe for both a simple sprain and a mallet finger injury (assuming it's a closed injury without significant tendon disruption)? If active extension is compromised, suggesting a mallet finger, would that influence the prognosis or the duration of splinting? 3. For pain management, are there any specific NSAIDs you prefer in these situations, or can I leave it to patient preference and tolerance? Should we consider a short course of oral steroids if the pain and swelling are particularly severe, or would"

So, to summarize, we'll proceed with a dynamic ultrasound to assess the soft tissue structures, prescribe NSAIDs for pain, and apply a splint immobilizing the DIP in slight hyperextension. We'll re-evaluate the patient in 7-10 days with a standard x-ray to rule out any occult or delayed fracture presentation. If active extension is compromised at that point, confirming a mallet finger diagnosis, we'll anticipate a longer splinting duration of 8 weeks or more. Just a couple of final points for my own clarity: 1. If the ultrasound reveals a significant tear of the collateral ligaments or volar plate, would that alter our management approach? Would surgical intervention be considered in such cases, or would conservative management with prolonged splinting still be the preferred approach? 2. Regarding hand therapy, you mentioned referral after 8 weeks if stiffness or limited function persists."

Also, considering the patient's history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis, are there any specific inflammatory or reactive processes that could mimic a cystic lesion in this location that we should consider in our differential?

I hadn't initially considered ecthyma gangrenosum given the seemingly normal WBC count, but the patient's immune status hasn't been fully explored. We haven't performed a skin biopsy yet. I'll order one now to get histopathology and tissue cultures. This will help differentiate between the various possibilities, including pyoderma gangrenosum which I was also considering. To clarify the patient's immune status, could you recommend any specific tests I should order? I'm thinking HIV, hepatitis panel, and perhaps a quantitative immunoglobulin assay.

One final question \u2013 while we've focused on the most pressing issues, I'd like to touch on post-operative care. Assuming a successful delivery and maternal stabilization, are there any specific post-operative considerations for this patient given the uterine rupture, such as increased risk of infection, thromboembolism, or future fertility implications depending on the surgical approach (repair vs. hysterectomy)? Any specific recommendations for pain management or post-operative monitoring would also be helpful. While the immediate emergency takes precedence, I want to be prepared for the"

Regarding conservative vs. surgical management, I'm leaning towards conservative treatment initially, given the acute nature of the injury (just a few hours old). His pain is severe (8/10), but he hasn't had any prior treatment for this issue. I'd suggest starting with a course of NSAIDs, perhaps a short course of oral steroids, and early physical therapy focusing on core strengthening, flexibility, and nerve gliding exercises.

While a herniated disc can occur suddenly, the repetitive stress from weightlifting could have predisposed him. I'll assess his squatting technique in detail when I examine him. Do you think it's worthwhile to involve a physical therapist early on, even before the initial pain subsides, to address any potential form issues and prevent recurrence?

Additionally, given his regular gym activity, I'm wondering if there could be any underlying facet joint issues or even spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis that might have been exacerbated by the squat.

Given the patient's eye involvement, I'd also suggest collecting a sample for conjunctival swab for NAAT and/or culture. While less common, gonococcal conjunctivitis can be a serious complication. Should we also consider testing for other STIs given the patient's risk factors? Specifically, I'm thinking about syphilis, HIV, and herpes simplex virus. While their presentations don't perfectly align with the current symptoms, testing would be prudent given the patient's sexual history. Finally, while we're pursuing the DGI diagnosis aggressively,"

While this can be a symptom of IBS, could it also suggest a functional defecatory disorder? Should we consider anorectal manometry or other tests to assess pelvic floor function if the other tests come back negative? Also, while the absence of blood is reassuring, given the duration of symptoms, should we consider a flexible sigmoidoscopy as a less invasive alternative to a full colonoscopy if the calprotectin is elevated or other results are inconclusive?

Before we conclude, I have a couple of clarifying questions. While the patient denies weight loss, they haven't specifically quantified their food intake. Could the persistent diarrhea be contributing to malabsorption despite a stable weight, especially considering the potential for Giardiasis? Should we consider asking the patient to keep a food diary to assess their caloric intake and look for any patterns related to their symptoms? Secondly, the patient mentioned another camper also experienced illness. Do you think it would be beneficial to inquire about the nature and duration of their symptoms?

While fecal calprotectin is a good screening tool, if it comes back elevated, would you recommend proceeding directly to colonoscopy, or would a flexible sigmoidoscopy be sufficient as a first step, especially considering the patient's age and absence of alarming features like blood in the stool or significant weight loss?

A gynecologic oncologist is best equipped to manage these complications. * **Symptoms:** The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, increased abdominal girth, and abdominal pressure are consistent with ovarian cancer.

She presents with a one-month history of increasing abdominal girth, shortness of breath exacerbated by exertion, and a sense of abdominal pressure and fullness. She denies any changes in bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, appetite changes, or weight fluctuations. No abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge is reported. Her family history is negative for ovarian or other gynecological cancers. The physical exam revealed a large ovarian mass, and her workup shows a right-sided pleural effusion, significant ascites, and a large mass in the right ovary on ultrasound. Interestingly, her CA-125 is normal. Her CBC is unremarkable, with a hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, suggesting she may be slightly anemic, but this could be dilutional given the ascites. Given the ascites and pleural effusion, my primary concern is a malignant ovarian process, despite the normal CA-125."

While a malignant process is certainly top of mind, the normal CA-125, her age, and lack of significant symptoms other than those related to the mass and fluid accumulation make me wonder about other possibilities. Could this be a benign process like a large, complicated ovarian cyst, perhaps with torsion or rupture leading to the ascites and pleural effusion? Or even a benign ovarian fibroma with Meigs' syndrome? Though less likely given the size of the mass and the rapidity of symptom onset, these should be considered. Would you also recommend obtaining other tumor markers, such as HE4, CEA, or CA 19-9, to further evaluate for malignancy?

Should we also consider adding AFP and beta-hCG to the tumor marker panel to help differentiate these possibilities? Also, in terms of surgical approach, would you anticipate a laparoscopic approach versus a laparotomy, given the size of the mass and the presence of ascites?

Given the presence of the right-sided pleural effusion, should we consider a thoracentesis as well, or will the effusion likely resolve with treatment of the primary ovarian pathology? Also, while germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumors are higher on the differential, we shouldn't completely rule out epithelial ovarian cancer, even with the normal CA-125. Are there any specific histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer that might present with a normal CA-125 and rapid accumulation of ascites in a young patient? Finally, regarding surgical staging, should we anticipate needing a full staging laparotomy with lymph node dissection and omentectomy, or will the surgical approach be tailored based on intraoperative findings?

Pre-operatively, we'll obtain HE4, AFP, and beta-hCG tumor markers and perform a diagnostic paracentesis with cytology.
