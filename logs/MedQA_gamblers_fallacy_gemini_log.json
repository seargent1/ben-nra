I agree that Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is the most likely diagnosis based on the constellation of symptoms \u2013 fluctuating proximal muscle weakness, diplopia worsening with sustained gaze, and ptosis, all corroborated by the positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the decremental response on EMG. However, I'd like to explore a few points before settling on that diagnosis. First, the patient mentions the diplopia is binocular and resolves with monocular occlusion. Could you clarify the nature of the diplopia from the neuro exam? Was it horizontal or vertical? This will help pinpoint the extraocular muscles involved and ensure it aligns with an MG presentation, which typically involves variable ocular misalignment. Second, while the EMG showed a decremental response, it would be helpful to know which muscles were tested. Proximal muscles are typically more affected in MG, so knowing the specific muscles tested will strengthen the diagnostic certainty. Did the report mention any post"

Unfortunately, the EMG report I have is a summary and doesn't specify the exact muscles tested or mention post-exercise facilitation. I'll request the full report from the lab to get that information. Specifically, I'll check if facial muscles, particularly orbicularis oculi or frontalis, were included, as their involvement can be highly suggestive of MG. While MG seems the most probable, given the fluctuating nature of the symptoms and the positive AChR antibodies, I'd like to consider other possibilities, however remote, until we have the complete picture. Could Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) be a differential, even with the positive AChR antibodies? I understand it's less common and usually associated with small cell lung cancer, but"

I'll also add a chest X-ray to the workup to screen for small cell lung cancer, given its association with LEMS. Regarding mitochondrial myopathies, I appreciate you raising that possibility. While the fatigability fits, the prominent ocular symptoms, particularly the diplopia and ptosis, make it less likely in my view. Are there specific mitochondrial myopathy subtypes that present with such prominent ocular findings? Should we consider genetic testing at this stage, or would it be more prudent to wait for the additional LEMS workup results?

While CPEO fits with the ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, the patient's fluctuating symptoms and prominent proximal limb weakness seem less characteristic of CPEO, which typically progresses more slowly and affects eye movements primarily. I'll still keep it in mind, but I'm leaning away from a mitochondrial etiology at this point. Given the patient's age and the overall clinical picture, I'm prioritizing ruling out LEMS before pursuing extensive mitochondrial workup. So, I'll order the VGCC antibody test and the chest X-ray as discussed. Once those results are back, we can revisit the mitochondrial possibility if LEMS is negative.

The timeline of symptom onset, a few months after starting natalizumab, further strengthens this suspicion. While the MRI findings are strongly indicative of PML, I'd like to discuss a few points to ensure we're covering all bases. First, has the JC virus antibody status been checked? This is crucial for confirming the diagnosis.

While the MRI findings are highly suggestive of PML, I'm also wondering if we should consider other differentials, however unlikely, just to be thorough. Given the patient's Crohn's, could inflammatory processes in the CNS be contributing, even though the MRI doesn't typically show the enhancement pattern we'd expect with active inflammation? Perhaps a lumbar puncture could be beneficial to assess CSF for inflammatory markers and rule out other infections or inflammatory conditions. Also, while the patient denies cognitive changes, could subtle cognitive deficits be masked by the more prominent motor symptoms? A brief neuropsychological assessment might be helpful to further characterize the extent of neurological involvement. Finally, what are your thoughts on initiating treatment for"

While the MRI is classic for PML, I want to be as comprehensive as possible.

The mother reports the distension has been present for a few days, coinciding with the onset of feeding difficulties. He cries when his abdomen is palpated, and the mother describes it as feeling hard. He seems to be pooping less than usual. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel segments and an absence of gas in the rectum, raising suspicion for an obstruction. The barium enema revealed a transition zone in the distal colon, highly suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is, of course, Hirschsprung's disease. The clinical picture and imaging findings are very consistent. However, before we proceed with surgical management, I'd like to discuss a few points. First, I'm curious about the newborn period.

Could the flow cytometry also help differentiate between DLBCL and other high-grade lymphomas like Burkitt lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma? What specific markers should we be looking for in the flow cytometry to help distinguish these? 2. **Infection screening:** Given the patient's B symptoms, should we consider any additional infectious disease screening beyond the HIV and Monospot already performed?

The absence of clicking or locking doesn't rule out a meniscus tear, as these are not always present. The negative valgus and varus stress tests suggest the collateral ligaments are intact. My main differential diagnoses include: 1. **Medial Meniscus Tear:** This is my top suspicion given the mechanism of injury and the localized medial joint line pain. 2. **Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS):** While the pain location fits, the mechanism of injury (acute onset after volleyball) and the worsening with descending stairs are less typical for PFPS. It's still a possibility, though. 3. **Medial Plica Syndrome:**"

Do you have any recommendations regarding NSAID use in patients with PCOS?

Should we also consider other diagnoses like a pes anserine bursitis or medial collateral ligament sprain, even though the valgus stress test was negative?

Did the patient mention any feeling of the kneecap shifting or popping out of place, even momentarily? This might not always be obvious to the patient, especially if it reduced spontaneously. Also, given the emphasis on descending stairs being more painful, could we be looking at a cartilage injury, specifically to the patellofemoral joint?

My initial differential includes vasovagal syncope, particularly situational (micturition syncope), orthostatic hypotension, and other less likely possibilities like cardiac arrhythmia or seizure. Given the normal ECG and lack of prodromal symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia, I'm less suspicious of a primary cardiac cause at this point.

This postpartum patient presents with fever, lower abdominal tenderness, heavier-than-usual lochia, and shortness of breath five days after a prolonged vaginal delivery of a macrosomic infant. My primary concern is postpartum endometritis, possibly complicated by a pulmonary embolism (PE). While breast engorgement and frequent urination are common postpartum findings, the combination of fever, lower abdominal tenderness localized to the uterus, and heavier lochia strongly suggests endometritis. The prolonged labor and macrosomic infant are both risk factors for uterine infection. The shortness of breath, however, raises the possibility of a PE, a serious postpartum complication. While she denies leg pain or swelling, the recent delivery, combined with dyspnea, warrants further investigation. The absence of chest pain doesn't rule out a PE.

Beyond endometritis and PE, are there any other diagnoses we should consider at this stage, given the constellation of symptoms? Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, although less common, comes to mind. Should we consider imaging of the pelvic veins if the ultrasound doesn't reveal a clear source for the fever and the D-dimer is elevated?

The bright red rectal bleeding, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and occasional pressure are highly suggestive of a prolapse, yet the defecography doesn't demonstrate it. My primary differential diagnosis remains rectal prolapse, possibly an internal intussusception, which might not be readily apparent on defecography. Other possibilities include internal hemorrhoids, although the described symptoms lean more towards a prolapse. Less likely, but still worth considering given the bleeding, are anal fissures, rectal polyps, or even early rectal cancer, though the lack of other concerning symptoms makes these less probable.

Before we proceed, I have a couple of clarifying questions: 1. Regarding the defecography, was it performed in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.)? Sometimes the prolapse only manifests in certain positions, and a single view might not capture it. 2.

The fact that it wasn't visualized on defecography could be due to the limitations of the study, especially if not performed in multiple positions. 2. **Paradoxical puborectalis contraction:** This also explains the normal defecography and the sensation of incomplete evacuation.

First, I'll ensure the defecography images are reviewed by a radiologist specializing in pelvic floor disorders, just to be absolutely certain nothing was missed on the initial interpretation. Second, regarding the flexible sigmoidoscopy, should we consider proceeding directly to a full colonoscopy instead? While the patient's symptoms are localized, a colonoscopy would allow us to evaluate the entire colon and rule out any other potential sources of bleeding or pathology higher up in the GI tract.

Before we conclude, I want to revisit the less likely differentials, specifically hemorrhoids and anal fissures.

Could the knee pain be referred from the hip, or are we suspicious of a separate ligamentous injury, perhaps from bracing against the dashboard?

Initial abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel loops concerning for distal obstruction. However, a contrast enema was subsequently normal. Despite this, the infant continues to have intermittent bilious vomiting, reduced urine output, and has not yet passed stool. An upper GI series was also read as normal. I'm puzzled by the persistent symptoms despite normal contrast enema and upper GI. My primary concern is malrotation with intermittent volvulus, even though the upper GI didn't demonstrate the classic \"corkscrew\" appearance. My differential also includes other causes of intestinal obstruction such as Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, or a less likely possibility of an internal hernia or other anatomical abnormality.

A laparoscopy will allow us to directly visualize the bowel and identify any anatomical abnormalities or intermittent volvulus that may not be apparent on standard imaging. Before proceeding with laparoscopy, I'd like to clarify a couple of points. First, regarding the initial abdominal X-ray showing dilated bowel loops: was the level of obstruction clearly distal, or could it have been more proximal despite the appearance? This might influence our intraoperative focus. Second, I want to revisit the contrast enema. While it was reported as normal, did the fluoroscopy during the procedure show any unusual bowel movements or transient twisting that might suggest an intermittent volvulus that resolved spontaneously with the enema itself?

Are there any signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances that need to be addressed pre-operatively?

This might help delineate the anatomy and identify any subtle points of obstruction or malrotation that weren't evident on the previous studies. While I understand the laparoscopic visualization is the gold standard, this combined approach might offer additional real-time information.

The absence of a fracture on the initial X-ray doesn't rule out a small avulsion fracture, which can sometimes be difficult to see on plain radiographs. My main questions for you are: 1. **Would you recommend a repeat X-ray with a specific focus on the DIP joint, perhaps with a lateral view or even a dedicated hand series to better visualize a potential avulsion fracture?** Even if small, knowing its presence could influence management. 2. **Given the patient's pain level and the apparent inability to actively extend the"

Given the patient reported a \"catching\" sensation, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a small avulsed bone fragment becoming trapped within the joint. Could this be contributing to the catching sensation and limited extension? Would this be visible on ultrasound, or might an MRI be necessary to fully evaluate this?

The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, showing neutrophilic infiltration without infection. The patient also has Crohn's disease, which strengthens the diagnosis of PG as they are frequently associated. My main concern now is management. While the connection to Crohn's is established, I'd like to understand the current status of their Crohn's. Is it well-controlled? Have there been any recent flares? This will influence our approach to treating the PG. Also, I'm curious about the location and size of the ulcer.

This will help us avoid repeating ineffective treatments and tailor our approach. Given the confirmed PG diagnosis and the link with Crohn's, I'm leaning towards systemic treatment alongside topical wound care. Even if the ulcer is relatively small, the underlying inflammatory process driving both the PG and Crohn's suggests a systemic approach might be more effective in the long run. I'm thinking of starting with systemic corticosteroids, potentially prednisone, but I'm open to discussing other options like cyclosporine or infliximab, especially if the Crohn's is actively flaring.

Before we finalize the treatment plan, I'd like to clarify a few things. First, regarding the Crohn's disease activity, have we obtained recent inflammatory markers like CRP and fecal calprotectin? This will help us objectively assess the level of inflammation and guide our decision regarding the need for Infliximab or Adalimumab. While these biologics can address both conditions, they also carry a higher risk profile, so I'd prefer to reserve them for cases where the Crohn's is moderately to severely active. Second, regarding the topical clobetasol, are there any concerns about skin atrophy with prolonged use, especially under occlusion? While potent topical steroids are often necessary for PG, minimizing long-term side effects is important. Perhaps we could consider tapering the potency of the topical steroid once the lesion starts to improve."

While treating the underlying inflammation will ultimately address the pain, should we consider adding short-term pain management strategies? Perhaps topical lidocaine or oral analgesics? 2. **Wound care specifics:** Besides the topical clobetasol, what specific wound dressing would you recommend? Should we consider something absorptive, non-adherent, or with antimicrobial properties, even though the wound culture was negative? I want to optimize the healing environment. 3. **Patient education:** It's important to educate the patient about the chronic nature of PG and the potential for recurrence. We should also"

Is there a specific size cutoff or certain characteristics (e.g., depth, location, involvement of underlying structures) that would warrant a referral?

Also, considering the potential for DIC in the setting of placental abruption, should we also have coagulation factors (like cryoprecipitate and FFP) readily available? Finally, while placental abruption seems most likely, the absence of contractions after the bleeding started is nagging at me. Is there anything else besides uterine rupture that could explain the cessation of contractions in the context of a potential abruption?

I'll screen for GI and renal issues before starting the patient on either naproxen or meloxicam. The Medrol Dosepak is a good option, and I'll ensure the patient understands the tapering schedule. Regarding the McKenzie exercises, I agree that avoiding flexion initially is prudent. I'll instruct the patient on the proper technique for the extension exercises and monitor their response closely. We'll incorporate nerve glides as well. I understand your recommendation to hold off on surgical intervention for now, given the acuteness of the presentation. However, given the patient's significant functional impairment, I'd like to propose a slightly more aggressive follow-up schedule. How about we re-evaluate the patient in two weeks to assess their response to conservative management?

Depending on the colonoscopy findings, we'll then consider further investigations like repeat biopsies for microscopic colitis or a trial of cholestyramine for possible bile acid diarrhea. We'll also discuss stress management strategies and potentially a low FODMAP diet if IBS is confirmed. One final question \u2013"

The ultrasound confirms a large right ovarian mass and significant ascites, while the chest x-ray reveals a right-sided pleural effusion. Interestingly, her CA-125 is normal. This raises some questions. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, but the normal CA-125 makes me consider other possibilities. What are your initial thoughts given the normal CA-125 in the presence of a large ovarian mass and ascites? Do you think a biopsy of the ovarian mass is warranted at this stage? Also, given the pleural effusion, should we consider a thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes?

Also, are there any other features we should be looking for on the ultrasound that might point towards a fibroma or thecoma, such as calcifications or a specific sonographic appearance? Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms over just one month, I'm still leaning towards malignancy, even with the normal CA-125. Could this be a less common ovarian cancer subtype that doesn't typically elevate CA-125?

For instance, is there a typical age range or associated hormonal manifestations we should consider? Also, while we've discussed Meigs syndrome and several ovarian cancer subtypes, could the ascites and pleural effusion be related to a separate process altogether?

Lung cancer, for example, could explain the pleural effusion, but would it typically present with such significant ascites?
