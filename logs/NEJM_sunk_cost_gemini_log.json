Given the patient's history and the confirmation of exogenous ochronosis, what are your preferred treatment approaches in this scenario?

Should we be concerned about ochronosis developing in other areas where she might have applied the cream, even if they aren't currently showing the bluish-brown discoloration? Would you recommend examining other potential application sites like the neck, chest, or hands, as a precaution? 2.

Would you consider starting even lower, perhaps with 0.01% or using it every other night initially, to minimize irritation and improve adherence? Also, do you have a preference for a specific vehicle (cream, gel, microsphere) in these cases?

One final question \u2013 while the biopsy and presentation strongly suggest exogenous ochronosis from hydroquinone, are there any other differential diagnoses we should consider, even remotely, at this stage? I'm thinking particularly about conditions that might mimic the bluish-brown discoloration, like minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation or even a rare pigmentary disorder.

I'll focus on managing the ochronosis and educating the patient about the risks of unregulated online skincare products. Just to be completely thorough, and considering she initially used the hydroquinone for pre-existing hyperpigmentation, would you recommend any baseline hormonal testing, like thyroid function or prolactin levels, to rule out any underlying contributing factors that might have predisposed her to hyperpigmentation in the first place? While unlikely, it could be helpful to have that information on file, especially if the response to tretinoin isn't as robust as expected.

I agree that the chest x-ray and potential PPI/ICS trial are good next steps if we don't find anything else. Before we proceed with those, I'd like to propose a couple of less invasive options. First, given the six-month duration and the seemingly benign nature of the cough, could we consider a short course of speech therapy focused on cough suppression techniques? This could be particularly helpful if there's a component of habit cough or if a sensory hypersensitivity is contributing. Second, I'm curious about the patient's sleep quality. While they denied snoring or apnea, could a sleep study be beneficial to definitively rule out any subtle sleep-disordered breathing that might be exacerbating the cough? Even mild upper airway resistance during sleep could be a factor. Finally, I'd"

Given the patient's description of the cough as a \"tickling\" sensation, and the fact that it's been ongoing for six months with no other identifiable cause, I'm wondering about the possibility of a neuropathic cough.

Even if the cough has a psychogenic component, a pulmonologist would first rule out any underlying physical lung issues and could then coordinate care with a psychologist or psychiatrist if necessary. An ENT might be considered for UACS, and a gastroenterologist for GERD, but given the lack of clear indicators for either and the chronicity of the cough, a pulmonologist is the best starting point for a comprehensive respiratory evaluation."

While the doctor also orders a blood glucose test due to the possible association of necrobiosis"

The fact that the pressure is relieved by lying down is somewhat unusual, though not unheard of in HF, and could potentially point to something else. My primary concern is diastolic heart failure, given the long-standing nature of the symptoms and the absence of significant weight changes. The \"fullness\" she describes could be related to hepatic congestion. The patient mentions previous echocardiograms showing something \"different\" about her heart.

Given the unusual pressure relief with recumbency, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a *mass* in the pericardium or even within the heart itself. Could this pressure be related to positional changes of such a mass? While less likely than diastolic HF or constrictive pericarditis, I think it's worth considering.

However, I'm still leaning towards a cardiac etiology as the primary driver of her symptoms, given the persistent pressure below the ribs and the \"different\" heart finding on prior echocardiograms. Before we proceed with the cardiac MRI, I'd like to obtain those prior echo reports. Knowing the specifics of those findings will help us tailor the MRI protocol and focus on the areas of greatest concern.

Scleroderma, specifically diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, comes to mind given the skin thickening, Raynaud's phenomenon (implied by the cold sensitivity), and potential for esophageal involvement explaining the dysphagia. The peripheral neuropathy could also be explained by scleroderma. However, the greasy rash, while potentially"

Could the rash be a separate, coincidental issue? Or could there be an underlying connective tissue disease that explains all of these findings?

The patient describes the itching as accompanied by a burning, throbbing sensation. Importantly, the VZV antibody test was negative, ruling out shingles, and the skin biopsy and culture were normal, making contact dermatitis and phytophotodermatitis less likely. The patient denies any new exposures, insect bites, new medications, or recent travel. Given the negative findings so far, and the persistent linearity of the rash, I'm wondering about a few less common possibilities. Firstly, while the patient denies new skin growths, could this be a manifestation of linear morphea or lichen planus, perhaps in an atypical presentation? Secondly, though less likely given the chronicity and lack of other systemic symptoms, could we be looking at a bizarre presentation of"

I'm leaning slightly towards morphea given the description of \"crater-like\" lesions, which could suggest dermal involvement and potential early sclerosis. However, the intense itching is more characteristic of lichen planus. Before we proceed with a deeper biopsy, I have a few more questions to clarify the picture: 1. Could you describe the color of the rash itself? Is it violaceous, hyperpigmented, or skin-colored? This might help differentiate between the two. Lichen planus often has a violaceous hue. 2. Has the patient noticed any thickening or hardening of the skin in the affected area? This would further support morphea. 3.

Before I schedule the patient for another biopsy, I wanted to run a couple more things by you. Given the negative initial biopsy and the chronicity, I'm also considering the possibility of a chronic dermatophyte infection, albeit an unusual presentation. While the patient denies travel, could a non-endemic fungus be mimicking this linear pattern? Should we consider a fungal culture specifically targeting atypical dermatophytes? Also, while less likely given the lack of systemic symptoms, could this be a form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, particularly given the potential for photosensitivity with some subtypes?

Before we proceed with the biopsy and cultures, I have a couple of final clarifying questions for the patient: 1. Regarding the \"crater-like\" appearance the patient described, can we get more detail? Are these lesions truly depressed, or are they more like papules with central crusting or keratotic plugs? This distinction could further differentiate between morphea (potentially with follicular plugging) and lichen planus (papules). 2.

The patient's history of corneal transplants and the combination of visual symptoms strongly suggest the need for an ophthalmologist's expertise.

This will help us evaluate the curvature and regularity of the cornea, which could be affected by the graft or subsequent complications. Beyond graft rejection, are there other corneal complications related to the transplants that we should consider, such as delayed endothelial decompensation, interface inflammation, or suture-related issues? Given the lower eyelid retraction, could this be related to cicatricial changes or other complications from the transplant surgery itself, rather than a separate issue? Finally, while the initial neurological exam was normal, the patient's description of peripheral vision loss and difficulty with depth perception still gives me pause. Even if my"

I'm particularly interested in seeing if there's any evidence of subtle optic nerve swelling or atrophy that might not have been apparent on the initial exam. Regarding the corneal topography, do you think we should also consider pachymetry to assess corneal thickness? This could provide further information about corneal edema and help differentiate between different types of graft rejection or other corneal pathologies. In terms of the patient's history of corneal transplants, do we know the indication for the original transplants? Understanding the underlying cause could give us clues about her current condition. For example, if she had a condition predisposing her to recurrent corneal issues, that might influence our differential diagnosis.

Interestingly, his blood work reveals a significantly elevated eosinophil count of 2660, while kidney function is normal. He reports itching and hives after ingesting certain foods like shellfish, nuts, and strawberries, suggesting a possible allergic tendency. He denies recent travel, trauma, fevers, chills, weight loss, or family history of kidney disease. My primary concern with the elevated eosinophils and the allergic history is the possibility of some form of allergic interstitial nephritis.

I'm curious about your thoughts on the significance of the lack of proteinuria so far. While the absence doesn't rule out IgA nephropathy or even early stages of AIN, it does seem to make them slightly less likely, doesn't it? Should we consider other, less common causes of glomerular hematuria like thin basement membrane nephropathy, Alport syndrome (though the lack of family history argues against this), or even benign familial hematuria? While these are often asymptomatic, the presence of pyuria and eosinophilia makes me wonder if something else is at play.

I agree with the diagnosis of laryngeal candidiasis based on the laryngoscopy findings, positive Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain, and the patient's response to inhaled corticosteroids for COPD. However, a couple of things are giving me pause. While the hyperkeratinized squamous epithelium is consistent with chronic irritation, which could be from the fungal infection, it also raises a small flag regarding dysplasia, especially given his heavy smoking history. Also, while the patient denies current mouth involvement, laryngeal candidiasis without oral thrush is less common. My first question is about the appearance of the plaques on laryngoscopy. Were they easily scraped off, or did they appear more fixed? This could give us a better sense of whether there's a significant keratotic component. Secondly, I'd like to know if the specialist considered leukoplakia in their differential, even though the biopsy suggests candidiasis"

However, I will review the laryngoscopy video myself to confirm this. My main concern, echoing yours, is the possibility of leukoplakia mimicking or coexisting with the candidiasis. The hyperkeratosis on biopsy, even in the context of a fungal infection, raises that suspicion. Did the specialist note any erythroplakia (red patches) during the laryngoscopy? This, combined with leukoplakia, would significantly increase the concern for dysplasia/carcinoma. Furthermore, given the patient's history of heavy smoking, even if the candidiasis resolves completely, I think close surveillance with repeat laryngoscopy at regular intervals ("

No erythroplakia was noted, thankfully. A couple of further questions: 1. Regarding the antifungal treatment, what duration and dosage are you recommending? Given the potential for underlying leukoplakia/dysplasia, a more aggressive or longer course might be warranted to ensure complete eradication of the candidiasis, allowing for a clearer picture on repeat laryngoscopy. 2.

I have a few more thoughts/questions: 1. While we're treating the presumed candidiasis, should we consider adding a topical antifungal as well, such as nystatin suspension or clotrimazole troches? This might provide additional benefit, especially given the somewhat fixed nature of the plaques observed on laryngoscopy. 2.

I have a couple of final clarifying questions: 1. Regarding the repeat laryngoscopy and biopsy, what timeframe are we looking at post-completion of the Fluconazole course? Should we wait a specific amount of time to allow the mucosa to heal fully and avoid any potential inflammatory changes that might confound the histopathological interpretation? 2.

Also, regarding Beh\u00e7et's, if the pathergy test is negative and the autoimmune markers are also negative, would you still consider Beh\u00e7et's a possibility, or would that effectively rule it out?"

I'll ask the patient about any gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or blood in his stool, to explore the possibility of Crohn's, even though the lesions are isolated to the penis. Has pyoderma gangrenosum been reported in the genital area without other skin involvement? The biopsy findings of epidermal necrosis and dense inflammatory infiltrate seem consistent with a neutrophilic process, so that avenue seems promising. Regarding the neutrophilic dermatoses, are there any specific subtypes you'd recommend investigating further, or would a general workup for neutrophilic dermatoses be appropriate at this stage? Should we consider a skin biopsy from a separate, unaffected area to look for any subclinical evidence of a broader dermatosis? I'll also ask the patient about any history of trauma or injury to the genital"

While the initial symptoms suggested a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI), the negative STI tests, combined with the recurring nature of the sores, the biopsy findings (epidermal necrosis, pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia, and inflammatory infiltrate), and the consideration of fixed drug eruption, all point towards a dermatological issue. Dermatologists specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the skin, hair, and nails, including unusual or complex skin disorders. The doctor is clearly moving away from an infectious disease model and focusing on other potential causes best evaluated by a skin specialist."
