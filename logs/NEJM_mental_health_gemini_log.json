I'm strongly suspecting exogenous ochronosis induced by hydroquinone, given the patient's history of prolonged use of a 4% hydroquinone cream, the bluish-brown discoloration concentrated on sun-exposed areas of the face, and the accompanying erythema and telangiectasias. The fact that the symptoms worsened after starting the cream further strengthens this suspicion. However, I'd like to discuss a few points to solidify the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. First, while the patient describes the packaging, confirming the exact product and its ingredients would be helpful. Some products marketed for skin lightening may contain other ingredients that could contribute to these symptoms or even adulterants like steroids. Could we obtain a sample of the cream for analysis if the patient still has it? Second, while less likely given the history, we should consider other pigmentary disorders in the differential.

Besides melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, should we also consider other differentials like Riehl's melanosis or drug-induced pigmentation, even though the presentation seems classic for ochronosis? While obtaining the cream is ideal, if the patient can't locate it, could we consider a Wood's lamp examination? Would that offer any additional clues to differentiate ochronosis from these other possibilities? Finally, what's your recommended approach to management after confirming ochronosis? Are there any topical treatments or procedures you've found effective in your experience, like lasers or chemical peels, to address the hyperpigmentation and telangiectasias?

Drug-induced pigmentation is a broader category; are there any specific medications besides hydroquinone that we should consider based on this presentation, or would the biopsy be sufficient to differentiate? I appreciate the treatment recommendations. In your experience, are there any specific types of chemical peels or laser parameters that are particularly effective for ochronosis, or does it vary significantly depending on the patient's skin type and the extent of the pigmentation?

We have a child recently arrived from Brazil with painful cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and now we see eosinophilia on the CBC. Initially, mumps was high on my differential given the parotitis and fever, but the lack of other viral symptoms, the weight loss, and especially the eosinophilia point away from that. The travel history makes me concerned about something parasitic or perhaps even something more unusual. My top differentials at this point, given the travel history and eosinophilia, are: 1. **Toxocariasis:** Playing with monkeys raises a flag for possible exposure to roundworm eggs. The lymphadenopathy, fever, and eosinophilia fit, though the lack of prominent eye involvement is less typical. 2. **Filariasis:** While less common, it's still possible given the travel history.

I'll add abdominal pain and bowel habit changes to my list of questions for the patient's mother. Beyond the specific tests you mentioned (stool O&P x 3 and serology for *Strongyloides*, *Toxocara*, and filarial species), would you also recommend a complete blood count with differential to monitor the eosinophil count, and perhaps liver function tests to assess for any hepatic involvement, which can be seen in some parasitic infections?

Also, are there any other rare diagnoses we should keep in the back of our minds, given this unusual presentation?"

This discrepancy between the initial findings and the imaging/bone marrow results is throwing me off. My primary concern remains the significantly elevated LDH. While IVLBCL was a strong initial suspicion, the lack of other supporting evidence weakens that diagnosis. I'd like to explore other possibilities that could explain this extreme LDH elevation. 1. **Could the LDH be a lab error?** I think it's crucial to repeat the LDH test to rule out any technical issues.

Regarding a second biopsy, where would you recommend taking it from, given the negative bone marrow and the non-specific nature of the skin lesions now that the imaging is negative? Should we consider an excisional biopsy of a skin lesion for more comprehensive analysis, or is there another site you'd prioritize?

The normal CBC argues against many common bacterial infections, but could something like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or Cytomegalovirus (CMV) present this way with predominantly skin manifestations and such a high LDH? Should we be testing for specific fungal infections like Histoplasmosis or Coccidioidomycosis, even though the patient hasn't traveled? Or are there other, less common infections we should explore?

The chest x-ray showing circumferential pericardial calcification and pleural effusions raises the possibility of constrictive pericarditis, especially given the patient's long-term asbestos exposure. The patient denies any history of pericarditis, but that doesn't rule it out. The lack of typical constrictive pericarditis findings on the echo is puzzling, though. Perhaps the constriction is early or subtle. My primary concern is the discrepancy between the imaging and the relatively normal echo.

If the biopsy shows inflammation and hyperkeratosis, but not conclusively seborrheic dermatitis, are there any other conditions that mimic this histological picture that we should be considering? Specifically, could this be an unusual presentation of a granulomatous dermatitis, or perhaps even a drug eruption, although she reports only taking a multivitamin? Given the patient's three-year history and the lack of response to hydrocortisone, I'm still leaning towards a chronic condition.

The presentation strongly suggests shingles, or herpes zoster, given the linear distribution of crusted lesions on the back, the intense pruritus, and the associated burning pain, particularly at night. The positive Tzanck smear showing multinucleated giant cells and acantholytic cells confirms this diagnosis. My primary concern now is managing the patient's discomfort and preventing potential complications. Before we discuss treatment, I wanted to confirm a few things. The notes mention the rash hasn't spread \u2013 has that remained consistent since the initial consultation? Also, while the location is typical, it's slightly unusual for shingles to present solely across the back in a band-like distribution. Did the physical exam reveal any satellite lesions outside the primary band? Finally, I want to understand the patient's overall health status. Are there any immunocompromising conditions or medications that we should be aware of that might affect treatment decisions or prognosis?"

The rash hasn't spread beyond the initial band-like distribution across the back, and there were no satellite lesions observed during the examination. The patient denies any known immunodeficiencies or current use of immunosuppressant medications. However, she is in her late 60s, which itself represents a degree of age-related immunosenescence. I'm particularly interested in your perspective on the unusual band-like presentation across the back. While dermatomal, it's not following a typical thoracic nerve root distribution. Could this be zoster sine herpete, with the pain and itching preceding more typical vesicular eruptions? Or perhaps a less common presentation of herpes zoster affecting multiple adjacent dermatomes simultaneously?

Given the four-month duration, I'm concerned about the potential for chronic postherpetic neuralgia. Besides antivirals, what adjunctive therapies do you recommend for pain management in this case? Would you consider a topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, or a tricyclic antidepressant? Also, given the unusual band-like presentation, should we consider further investigations to rule out any underlying conditions contributing to this atypical presentation, such as a localized immune deficiency or even a paraneoplastic syndrome, although I acknowledge the latter is less likely given the absence of other systemic symptoms?"

Before we conclude, I have a couple of further questions. Firstly, given the duration of the rash, is there a role for a referral to a pain specialist at this stage, considering the potential for chronic postherpetic neuralgia? Early intervention might improve long-term pain management outcomes. Secondly, while we are pursuing investigations for underlying causes, should we also consider a skin biopsy for histopathological examination? While the Tzanck smear is supportive of herpes zoster, a biopsy could provide more definitive information and potentially rule out other mimicking conditions, especially given the atypical presentation. It could also assess the degree of dermal involvement"

While it won't necessarily change the immediate management with antivirals and pain control, it might influence longer-term management strategies.

Initially, pneumonia, bronchitis (possibly exacerbated by his asthma), and TB were high on my differential. The chest x-ray showed upper lobe-predominant peripheral and subpleural consolidations, which could be consistent with pneumonia. However, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showing 74% eosinophils throws a wrench in the works. This points towards a non-infectious process, possibly eosinophilic pneumonia. Interestingly, the tests for common infectious causes, including fungal infections like Coccidioides and Aspergillus, were negative. Also"

He did mention a new air freshener he started using about six months ago, which I initially dismissed, but now I'm wondering if that could be a contributing factor to a drug-induced or hypersensitivity reaction leading to eosinophilic pneumonia. I'm leaning towards chronic eosinophilic pneumonia given the subacute, three-month history of symptoms. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia typically presents more abruptly.

Should we consider imaging of the kidneys and ureters, like an ultrasound, to rule out structural abnormalities or small stones that might not be visible on a CT urogram?

Is there a way to assess for past strep infection beyond the ASO titer, perhaps anti-DNase B? Also, should we consider a 24-hour urine collection for protein and creatinine to further evaluate for glomerular disease? Given the combination of hematuria and pyuria, even with a negative culture, should we consider a less common infection like tuberculosis, particularly given the chronic nature?

I'll add a syphilis PCR from the lesion to the testing plan along with the HSV PCR. Given that Beh\u00e7et's is still on the differential, even if less likely, are there any specific questions I should ask the patient when he returns that might point us in that direction? I've already asked about other systemic symptoms, but perhaps there are more specific manifestations I should inquire about, such as oral or genital aphthous ulcers, eye involvement, or skin lesions elsewhere on the body? Should I also be considering any other autoimmune conditions at this stage, given the recurring nature of the ulcers? While we wait for the PCR results, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a traumatic etiology, perhaps related to sexual practices. Although he"

I agree that the prodrome makes traumatic etiology less likely, but I'll gently inquire about sexual practices just to be absolutely certain we aren't missing anything. Given that we're expanding the workup to include a syphilis PCR from the lesion, should we also consider other ulcerative STIs like chancroid or lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)? While the presentation doesn't perfectly fit the classic descriptions, I want to be comprehensive, especially if the HSV PCR is also negative. Would you recommend testing for those as well, or are they low enough on the differential to hold off for now? Regarding autoimmune conditions, if the infectious workup comes back negative, are there any specific autoimmune diseases you'd recommend testing for, or would a more general autoimmune"

I appreciate the recommendation to refer to Dermatology or Rheumatology if the infectious workup is negative, rather than ordering a broad range of autoimmune tests myself. That makes sense in terms of a targeted and efficient approach. Before the patient returns for the PCR and biopsy, I want to make sure I have a clear plan for the next steps depending on those results. If the HSV PCR is positive, that would explain the presentation, even with the negative serology. We'd manage it as genital herpes. But if the HSV PCR is negative, and the syphilis PCR is also negative, then we're back to considering Beh\u00e7et's more strongly, even without other systemic findings. The biopsy results will hopefully provide some additional clues. Assuming both PCRs are negative, and the biopsy is non-specific or shows inflammation consistent"

While the initial tests for common STIs (HSV, syphilis) were negative, the cyclical nature, prodromal symptoms (tingling before sores), and the possibility of false negatives warrant further investigation by a specialist in infections. * **Need for specialized testing and interpretation:** The doctor is recommending a PCR test and biopsy.
