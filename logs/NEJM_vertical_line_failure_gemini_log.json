The clinical presentation of bluish-brown discoloration, particularly perioral and on the cheeks and nose, further supports this. While she self-treated for presumed melasma, the lack of a formal diagnosis prior to starting the cream raises a red flag.

Given the patient's initial self-diagnosis of melasma, I'm curious about the possibility of underlying melasma being exacerbated by the hydroquinone. While the biopsy is consistent with ochronosis, could the pigment deposition be masking signs of melasma, or could they coexist? Should we consider additional tests, like dermoscopy, to differentiate between the two, or would that be redundant given the biopsy results?

However, to be absolutely certain, could you clarify which heavy metals are most commonly associated with skin pigmentation changes?

Before we proceed with treatment options like retinoids, peels, or lasers, I\u2019d like to discuss a few more points: 1. **Confirmation of Hydroquinone:** While we strongly suspect hydroquinone is the culprit, is there a way to test the WhiteGlow cream directly for its presence, even if we can\u2019t locate the manufacturer? Perhaps a chemical analysis of the remaining cream in the tube, if the patient still has it? This would provide definitive proof and strengthen the case against using unregulated online skincare products. 2. **Dermoscopy and Melasma:** You mentioned dermoscopy could help differentiate between ochronosis and melasma.

However, given the possibility of coexisting melasma, performing dermoscopy before initiating any pigment-reducing treatments seems prudent. If we observe a reticular or blotchy pattern alongside the homogenous blue-gray discoloration, it would strengthen the case for concomitant melasma. This information would be valuable for tailoring the treatment approach. Would you agree?

The slightly elevated eosinophil count is interesting, though not dramatically high.

The normal ultrasound of the lymph nodes is also helpful in ruling out more immediately concerning structural abnormalities.

I'll ask the patient specifically about any dampness or visible mold in their home or workplace. I agree that \"hot tub lung\" and bird fancier's lung are less probable given the lack of reported exposure, but checking for specific antibodies, as you suggested, could help rule them out definitively. Which specific antibodies would you recommend testing for in this case to cover those less common hypersensitivity pneumonitis subtypes? Given the strong suspicion for sarcoidosis, should we proceed with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and a high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) of the chest at this stage? The HRCT could provide more detailed information about the extent and pattern of lung involvement, and PFTs could help assess lung function and detect any restrictive or obstructive defects.

The biopsy of a skin lesion is positive for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1, further pointing towards a B-cell lymphoma. However, the PET/CT scan is surprisingly normal.

While false negatives on PET/CT are possible, they are less common with aggressive lymphomas, which the high LDH suggests this might be.

However, the patient's significant asbestos exposure 40 years ago raises a serious concern for mesothelioma, which can also present with similar symptoms and pericardial involvement. My primary concern is differentiating between constrictive pericarditis and mesothelioma, or the possibility of both coexisting. While the asbestos exposure makes mesothelioma a strong contender, the classic echocardiographic findings point towards constriction. I have a few questions: 1. Did the echocardiogram show any signs of pericardial thickening or other abnormalities besides the ventricular interdependence and discordant pressure tracings?

I'll contact the echocardiography lab to see if they can provide that information from the existing images. If not, we might need to repeat the echo with a focus on pericardial assessment. Beyond the imaging, I'm also considering the etiology of the potential constrictive pericarditis. Given the patient's history, we need to consider if the asbestos exposure could have played a role in causing the pericardial inflammation and subsequent constriction, even after such a long latency period.

Are there any particular contrast agents or techniques that would be beneficial in this scenario? Secondly, given the patient's age and the potential risks associated with a pericardial biopsy, what is your opinion on the risk-benefit ratio of performing the biopsy versus continuing with less invasive investigations, such as a repeat echocardiogram with strain imaging and a thorough review of the CT scan results we're expecting next week?

Do you anticipate any specific LGE patterns that might help distinguish these conditions?

Given that pleural effusions are also something to look for on the MRI, and the patient's chest x-ray already showed pleural effusions, I'm wondering about the nature of these effusions. Have we analyzed the pleural fluid yet? A pleural fluid analysis could provide valuable information in differentiating between various etiologies, including mesothelioma, benign asbestos-related pleural disease, and transudative effusions related to the constrictive pericarditis itself. Specifically, cytology could help identify malignant mesothelial cells, while biochemical markers could differentiate between transudates and exudates.

The patient's history of a waxy, bumpy, itchy rash predominantly on the face, thickened skin with pronounced lines, finger stiffness (particularly 4th and 5th digits), dysphagia, and unintentional weight loss raises strong suspicion for systemic sclerosis, specifically diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). However, the initial ANA, anti-Scl-70, CRP, and ESR were normal, and nailfold capillaroscopy didn't reveal any abnormalities. My main concern is the combination of skin thickening, Raynaud's-like symptoms (though not explicitly confirmed), and now significant dysphagia. The reported heartburn could be related to esophageal involvement. While the absence of positive serologies and normal capillaroscopy findings are not typical for dcSSc, they don't rule it out, especially in early stages. I have a few questions: 1"

I'm also wondering about the possibility of eosinophilic fasciitis, given the skin thickening and finger contractures. While the rash description doesn't perfectly fit the classic presentation of eosinophilic fasciitis, the \"woody\" induration and progressive contractures are making me consider it. Could we add a complete blood count (CBC) with differential to look for eosinophilia? A skin biopsy might also be helpful to differentiate between scleroderma and eosinophilic fasciitis, and could even point towards another diagnosis like morphea if localized.

I'm hesitant to dismiss it entirely without further investigation, especially given the unusual bilateral nature of the contractures.

My initial thought, given the description of dimming and blurring, was cataracts, especially with the reported worsening in the left eye. However, the normal slit-lamp exam makes this diagnosis less likely. The entropion could be contributing to some of the blurry vision, particularly in the left eye if it's more pronounced there, but it wouldn't explain the dimming and overall bilateral vision decline.

Steroids can exacerbate dry eye and potentially mask underlying issues. Therefore, I propose the following: 1. **Prioritize Entropion Management:** I'll ensure the patient is promptly evaluated by an oculoplastic specialist for the entropion. Surgical correction, if indicated, should be performed before considering steroids. This will help determine if the entropion is contributing to the blurred vision and discomfort. 2. **Aggressive Dry Eye Treatment:** Concurrently, we'll initiate aggressive dry eye treatment.

I appreciate you highlighting the importance of specific quantities as well, as that clearly played a role in this case. The patient's \"health kick\" wouldn't have seemed unusual if they were only consuming small amounts of carrots and sweet potatoes. This case has been a valuable learning experience for me. While I initially focused on serious conditions like hepatitis and AIHA, it ultimately came down to a simple dietary change. It reinforces the importance of considering all possibilities, no matter how seemingly benign, and the crucial role of a thorough history. I'm grateful for your guidance in navigating this diagnostic challenge. I'll follow up with the patient to reinforce the diagnosis of carotenemia, explain the connection to their diet, and provide reassurance. I"

However, the lack of other systemic symptoms and the presence of eosinophilia makes these less likely, though not impossible. Kidney stones were also considered, but again, the lack of pain makes this less probable. The elevated eosinophils are the most intriguing aspect. We've investigated some of the more common causes, including recent travel, allergies, and new medications, with no positive findings so far.

To further investigate the eosinophilia, we've queried the patient about recent dietary changes, including the introduction of any new proteins or foraged foods, as well as any recent insect bites, rashes, or skin irritations, thinking along the lines of a drug-induced interstitial nephritis, food allergy, or parasitic infection, even though the patient denies travel to endemic areas.

One more question for you \u2013 given the patient's persistent hematuria for three months, are there any specific features we should be looking for on the biopsy that would point us towards a particular diagnosis, perhaps something we haven't discussed yet?

However, the laryngoscopy findings of white plaques on the vocal cords, along with the microscopic findings of hyperkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium and threadlike filaments staining positive with Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain, significantly shift the differential.

You mentioned the chronic cough could contribute via an altered local environment. Could you elaborate on this a bit?

We have a patient with recurrent, painful genital ulcers, occurring roughly monthly for the past year, now increasing in frequency. He's HIV positive with a detectable viral load, but his CD4 count is still within a relatively normal range. The negative HSV-1/2 and pending syphilis tests are throwing me off. While we await those syphilis results, the clinical picture isn't screaming primary syphilis to me. The chronicity and recurrence are atypical. Chancroid is also less likely given the absence of significant lymphadenopathy. My primary concern is that the HIV infection, even with a reasonable CD4 count, might be contributing to an unusual presentation of a more common infection, or even predisposing him to something less common. The biopsy showing epidermal necrosis and a dense inflammatory infiltrate is consistent with an infectious process, but doesn't pinpoint a"

I agree that chancroid is lower on the differential given the lack of prominent lymphadenopathy, but it's worth testing to rule out. I'll add that to the next round of tests. A repeat HSV PCR during an active outbreak is a good idea as well, especially considering the possibility of a false negative initially. Regarding Beh\u00e7et's, that's an interesting thought. He hasn't reported any oral or ocular lesions, which would be typical, but I suppose it's possible he has a less typical presentation, particularly in the context of his HIV infection. Has Beh\u00e7et's been reported with increased frequency or severity in HIV-positive individuals? Are there any specific features of the ulcers themselves that might point us towards Beh\u00e7et's rather than another etiology? A drug reaction is less"

I've already asked about ulcers elsewhere on his body, and he denied any, but I'll specifically ask about the mouth and eyes. The biopsy already performed showed nonspecific inflammation, but I'll keep a vasculitis workup in mind if these other tests come back negative. Given that the ulcers are recurring almost like clockwork, is there any infectious etiology that tends to follow such a regular pattern? I'm also wondering if the patient's HIV status, even with a decent CD4 count, could be causing an unusual manifestation of a relatively common infection, or making him more susceptible to opportunistic infections that might mimic more common ulcerative STIs. Could the cyclical nature of the outbreaks be related to hormonal fluctuations, even in a male patient? Is there any precedent for hormonal influence on ulcerative STIs or other infectious processes?"

Regarding CMV, while he\u2019s HIV positive, his CD4 count is still relatively robust. Wouldn't we expect a lower CD4 count before considering CMV as a primary driver of these genital ulcers? Are there any specific tests for CMV that you\u2019d recommend at this stage, given his CD4 count and the absence of systemic symptoms? Should we consider a CMV PCR from a lesion swab or blood test? You mentioned other opportunistic infections. Given the chronicity and relatively good CD4 count, are there any specific opportunistic infections besides CMV that you think are worth investigating?
