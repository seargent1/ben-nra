The patient's history of prolonged hydroquinone use for melasma, followed by the development of bluish-brown discoloration with pinpoint papules, strongly supports this diagnosis. I've already advised her to discontinue hydroquinone use. My main questions for you are regarding management. Given the chronicity of this condition, what treatment options do you recommend? I've seen some literature suggesting topical retinoids, chemical peels, and lasers like Q-switched ruby or Nd:YAG. What's your experience with these modalities in terms of efficacy and potential side effects, especially in a patient with Fitzpatrick skin type IV or higher (which I suspect given her history of melasma)? Are there any other emerging therapies we should consider? Also, what is the prognosis for repigmentation?"

I'll formally assess this at her next appointment. Given the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, I'm leaning towards starting with a topical retinoid, perhaps tretinoin, and monitoring her response closely. Do you have a preferred starting concentration and frequency for tretinoin in this context? Should we consider combining it with other topical agents, such as hydroquinone's alternatives like azelaic acid or kojic acid, to address any residual melasma? I'm hesitant to use hydroquinone again, obviously, given the ochronosis. While cryotherapy and dermabrasion are options, I share your reservations about their use in darker skin types. I'd prefer"

The risk of exacerbating the ochronosis seems to outweigh the potential benefit for the melasma, especially since we have other options like azelaic acid and potentially laser therapy down the line. Before we finalize the treatment plan, I have a couple more questions: 1. Could you elaborate on the specific laser parameters you'd recommend for the Q-switched ruby laser, assuming we decide to go that route after a trial of topical therapy? Things like fluence, pulse width, and spot size would be helpful. Also, how many sessions would you typically anticipate for a noticeable improvement? 2.

Before we proceed with the bronchoscopy, I'd like to suggest a few additional non-invasive tests. Given the crazy paving pattern on the chest x-ray, which can be seen in a variety of conditions, including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), I think it would be prudent to order a serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. While less likely given the absence of respiratory distress, a significantly elevated LDH could point us in that direction.

Could we add an anti-CCP antibody and ANA panel with extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) to the rheumatologic workup? While the patient doesn't describe joint pain, some connective tissue diseases can manifest primarily with pulmonary involvement. Also, regarding the occupational history, I want to be very specific. Does the patient work with birds, or have any bird hobbies? Exposure to bird droppings can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (bird fancier's lung).

The absence of travel history, risky behaviors, and other medical conditions narrowed the field somewhat. Kaposi Sarcoma was considered given the skin findings, but the biopsy results definitively point towards Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma (IVLBCL). The markedly elevated LDH and the characteristic histopathological findings of intravascular aggregates of atypical lymphocytes positive for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1 confirm this diagnosis.

I haven't formally assessed the patient's performance status using a standardized scale like ECOG, but based on the reported fatigue and the presence of painful leg sores impacting ambulation, I would estimate it to be around ECOG 1-2. While the patient hasn't reported neurological symptoms, given the potential for CNS involvement in IVLBCL, particularly in the cutaneous variant, should we consider a lumbar puncture to evaluate for CNS involvement? Additionally, given the unusual cutaneous presentation and the initially normal CBC and CMP, could this be a specific subtype of IVLBCL, such as the cutaneous variant or even a less common entity like intravascular B-cell lymphoma, unspecified type?

This could influence treatment intensity. Secondly, regarding the bone marrow biopsy, would you recommend a unilateral or bilateral procedure? Some studies suggest bilateral biopsies increase the diagnostic yield, especially in cases with subtle involvement. Finally, given the patient's estimated ECOG performance status of 1-2, and the potential for R-CHOP related toxicity, have you considered any dose adjustments or supportive care measures proactively?

Of course, a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment is paramount. Before we finalize the plan, I have a few remaining thoughts. Given the unusual cutaneous presentation, I'm still curious about the possibility of a less common subtype of IVLBCL, even beyond the cutaneous variant.

While consistent with IVLBCL, it's remarkably high. Could this suggest a more aggressive disease course or perhaps another underlying process contributing to the elevation? Should we consider any additional tests to investigate this further, such as a PET/CT scan?

However, the absence of a clear malignant pleural thickening on the initial chest x-ray and the normal PFTs are somewhat atypical. My primary concern is malignant mesothelioma, likely pleural, given the pleural effusions. The pericardial calcification could be related to prior asbestos exposure as well, potentially constrictive pericarditis, which could also contribute to the patient's symptoms.

A PET/CT is also a good suggestion, particularly given the somewhat atypical presentation with normal PFTs. It will offer better visualization of any subtle pleural thickening or nodularity that might have been missed on the initial chest x-ray and will be essential for staging if mesothelioma is confirmed.

I will gather more information about the specific dates of employment, the company they worked for, and the types of asbestos-containing materials they handled. This will be crucial not only for potential legal recourse but also for strengthening the link between asbestos exposure and the suspected mesothelioma. Given the patient's report of a sensation of a lump in their throat and slightly decreased appetite, I'm also wondering about the possibility of esophageal involvement or even a second primary malignancy.

First, given the patient's age and overall health status, what are your thoughts on the feasibility of aggressive treatment options like surgery or chemotherapy if mesothelioma is confirmed? I want to ensure we're considering the patient's quality of life alongside potential treatment benefits.

I agree that a repeat biopsy from a newer lesion, this time with IF, is warranted. Checking for Hepatitis C is also a good idea, I hadn't considered that connection. Before I schedule those, could you clarify a few things for me? Sometimes the descriptions patients give can be misleading. When you say \"greasy,\" is it possible the patient is misinterpreting the scaling often seen in lichen planus as greasy?

They are the most qualified to diagnose and treat conditions like patellar tendon ruptures, which often require surgical intervention."

While the patient doesn't report any known history of skin conditions, it's something to consider. Regarding the biopsy, if we proceed with one, should we target a crusted lesion or a more typical burrow, assuming we can find one?

Firstly, given the four-month duration, wouldn't we expect to see more widespread involvement if it were scabies? Could this prolonged, localized presentation suggest a different type of mite infestation, perhaps less common than scabies? Secondly, regarding the potential for cellulitis, what specific signs should I be looking for beyond the existing crusting and erythema? Should I advise the patient to monitor for things like increased warmth, pain, or lymphangitis?

If available, multi-modal imaging would certainly provide a more comprehensive assessment of the macula and surrounding structures. Given the patient's fall, I'm also wondering about their general health and balance. Could there be a contributing factor beyond vision, exacerbating their instability? Perhaps a neurological assessment beyond VEP, including a basic neurological exam focusing on gait and balance, would be beneficial. Finally, while we're considering rare possibilities, are there any other less common retinal conditions, beyond atypical AMD, that could present with these symptoms and normal initial findings? For example, could something like Stargardt disease, cone-rod dystrophy, or other inherited retinal dystrophies be considered, even"

I was hesitant to prescribe them empirically before having a clearer picture, but given the symptoms and laryngoscopy findings, a trial of PPIs seems warranted now, even before the biopsy results are back. Would you recommend a specific PPI and duration for the trial? Also, given the yellowish phlegm, could this also indicate a component of chronic laryngitis or even a low-grade bacterial infection superimposed on the reflux or leukoplakia?"
