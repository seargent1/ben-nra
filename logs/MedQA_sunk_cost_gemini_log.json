This patient presents with fluctuating, fatigable muscle weakness, predominantly in the upper limbs, along with diplopia that worsens in the evening. The symptoms are exacerbated by exertion and improve with rest. She also reports heavy eyelids. Given her profession as a graphic designer, which involves repetitive fine motor tasks, the symptoms are likely further aggravated by her work. The absence of sensory symptoms like numbness or tingling is notable. There's no reported family history of neurological conditions. My initial suspicion was myasthenia gravis, and I ordered an acetylcholine receptor antibody test and EMG. The results returned positive for AChR antibodies and showed a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation, which further supports this diagnosis.

The lack of autonomic symptoms also argues against LEMS. To address your question, no, she hasn't had a chest CT yet. That's a good point, and I'll order one to assess for a thymoma. Given the positive AChR antibodies, what's your opinion on initiating treatment for MG while we await the CT results?

My initial thought was to try some conservative management first, given the likely diagnosis of functional constipation. Would you recommend trying something like infant glycerin suppositories or lactulose before proceeding with a rectal exam, or should the rectal exam be prioritized to definitively rule out Hirschsprung's? I'm also wondering about the \"soft-serve\" consistency stools the mother described intermittently. While that could be explained by some leakage around a hard stool mass,"

Would you recommend a contrast enema at any point in the evaluation, or would that be premature at this stage?

No history of prior knee injury, no clicking, popping, or catching, but tenderness to palpation medially below the patella.

While I agree an MRI is the gold standard for visualizing the meniscus and MCL, given the lack of swelling and bruising, and the patient's description of the pain as sharp rather than a deep ache, I'm slightly more suspicious of an MCL sprain than a meniscus tear at this point. Meniscus tears, especially those involving the posterior horn, often present with clicking, catching, or locking, which this patient denies. Also, while pain with pivoting and twisting can occur in both, it's perhaps more characteristic of an MCL injury. Should the MRI reveal no meniscal or MCL tear, how would you feel about exploring patellar tracking issues further?

My current thinking is that if it *is* a patellar tracking issue, it's likely mild, given the lack of reported instability. Perhaps the increased activity level from volleyball practice exacerbated a pre-existing, but asymptomatic, predisposition to maltracking, leading to irritation of the medial retinaculum or other soft tissues around the patella. Given the patient's age (I should have mentioned this earlier - she's 16), I'm also wondering about the possibility of a growth plate injury, although the location doesn't quite fit the typical presentation of a distal femoral or proximal tibial physeal injury.

I'll also examine the patellar tendon for tenderness and thickening, although I suspect that if it were SLJ or OSD, the pain would be more anterior, not primarily medial. One other thought I had, although it's less likely given the lack of swelling and bruising, is a spontaneous osteochondral lesion (OCL) of the medial femoral condyle.

This patient presents with a rapidly growing, 6cm, mobile, non-tender breast mass in the upper outer quadrant, confirmed by imaging and biopsy as a phyllodes tumor. The biopsy shows leaf-like structures with stromal cellular overgrowth, which is characteristic. The rapid growth in just a month is concerning and raises the suspicion for malignancy, although the absence of skin changes or lymphadenopathy is somewhat reassuring. My primary concern is the potential for malignancy given the rapid growth. While benign phyllodes tumors are more common, the size and growth rate push this case into a grey area. I'm leaning towards recommending a wide local excision with a margin of at least 1cm, possibly even wider depending on the final pathology.

I'm still slightly concerned about the rapid growth. Even with phyllodes tumors, this pace seems unusually fast. While we're waiting for the IHC and mitotic rate, could we consider any additional imaging, like a chest CT or bone scan, to rule out distant metastasis, however unlikely that may be at this stage?

One more question regarding the IHC \u2013 are there any specific markers you'd recommend beyond the standard panel for ruling out metaplastic carcinoma and sarcoma?

While I agree that a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is now a strong contender, I'm still slightly perplexed by the lack of significant pain.

Beyond the MRI and sleep-deprived EEG, I'm also considering a few other points. First, while the semiology points towards temporal lobe epilepsy, the automatisms described as \"picking at something\" could also be seen in frontal lobe seizures. Although the EEG findings favor temporal, could the MRI protocol be tailored to carefully examine the frontal lobes as well?

Also, while a structural lesion is a possibility, considering his age, I'm also thinking about genetic etiologies. Has the possibility of benign rolandic epilepsy been considered? While the semiology isn't classic, the age and focal nature of the seizures make it worth exploring. Would a genetic panel be helpful at this stage, or should we wait for the MRI results before pursuing that avenue?

Given the mechanism of injury, the posterior hip dislocation, and now the bilateral knee pain, I'm wondering about the possibility of a dashboard injury. While the patient denies direct knee impact, the force transmitted through the femur during the collision could have caused ligamentous damage to both knees, even without a direct blow. Do you think an MRI of the knees would be beneficial at this stage, or should we wait to see the results of the X-rays first? I'm particularly concerned about the possibility of a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury or other ligamentous damage that might not be readily apparent on plain films. Also, should we consider a dedicated sacral view with the lumbar spine X-ray to better visualize the sacroiliac joints, given the potential for ligamentous injury in the pelvis as well?"

While the posterior hip dislocation is the most pressing issue, the bilateral knee pain and reported difficulty bending raise a flag for me. Assuming the knee and lumbar spine X-rays are negative, and the patient continues to experience significant knee pain and/or instability after the hip reduction, what would your threshold be for ordering knee MRIs?

The abdominal X-ray shows dilated bowel loops with no gas in the rectum. Critically, the rectal biopsy shows an absence of ganglion cells. My primary concern, given this constellation of findings, is Hirschsprung\u2019s disease. My initial exam revealed decreased bowel sounds and a noticeably distended abdomen.

A repeat X-ray in 7-10 days and careful scrutiny of the MRI for avulsion fragment size and tendon retraction will be very helpful in guiding management. I agree that gentle ROM exercises are usually sufficient post-splinting. Just to clarify a couple of points for my own understanding: When you say \"tendon retraction,\" are you referring specifically to the distance between the torn end of the extensor tendon and its insertion point on the distal phalanx? And in terms of fragment size, is there a general threshold beyond which surgical intervention becomes more strongly considered, even in the absence of significant displacement? For example, if the fragment involves more than a third of the articular surface, does that change your approach? Finally, regarding post-splinting hand therapy, what specific criteria would you use to determine if a patient would benefit from formal therapy versus home exercises? Would it be based on the"

So, if I understand correctly, a fragment involving more than 30-50% of the articular surface raises the possibility of surgical intervention even if it's not significantly displaced, primarily due to the increased risk of long-term joint instability or arthritis? And the degree of tendon retraction helps us gauge the potential for successful non-operative management, with greater retraction making conservative treatment less likely to achieve optimal outcomes? Regarding the post-splinting stiffness, extensor lag, and functional limitations you mentioned as indicators for hand therapy, could you elaborate on how these would be assessed in practice? Are there specific range of motion measurements or functional tests you typically use to make that determination? For instance, what degree of extensor lag at the DIP joint would you consider significant enough to warrant a referral to hand therapy?

Was it diagnosed as uveitis, episcleritis, or something else? When did it occur in relation to the skin lesion? This could help strengthen the suspicion for pyoderma gangrenosum or suggest another systemic inflammatory condition. 2. **Lesion appearance:** Could you describe the ulcer base? Is it necrotic,"

Before I contact the patient, I'd like to refine the differential a bit further.

My top differentials, in order of likelihood, are: 1. **Placental abruption:** The classic presentation aligns with this patient's symptoms. The sharp, tearing pain, heavy bleeding, and fetal distress strongly suggest this diagnosis. The lack of contractions despite being term also points away from labor as the primary cause. 2. **Uterine rupture:** While less common, especially in a primigravida (which we don't know if she is), the severe pain and signs of shock (tachycardia, hypotension) warrant consideration.

Bending, twisting, coughing, and sneezing exacerbate the symptoms. He denies any bowel or bladder dysfunction. An MRI confirms an L5-S1 disc herniation impinging on the adjacent nerve root. My primary diagnosis is right L5-S1 radiculopathy secondary to the disc herniation.

Do you think we should consider a brief period of relative rest, say a week or so, before progressing to those exercises? I want to avoid exacerbating the inflammation and pain. Also, given the mechanism of injury (deadlift with likely improper form), should we consider adding a postural assessment to the PT referral? It seems likely that underlying postural issues or muscle imbalances might have contributed to the injury. Addressing these could help prevent recurrence in the future.

My primary concern is CMV retinitis, given the classic presentation and the patient's severely immunocompromised state. While the ophthalmoscopy was reported as normal, I'm hesitant to rule out CMV retinitis solely based on that. Early CMV retinitis can be subtle and easily missed, especially without a high index of suspicion. The patient denies flashes of light, which is more characteristic of a retinal detachment, but the \"curtain\" description warrants careful consideration.

Should we consider empiric antibiotic treatment while we wait for the culture results, or is it best to wait for the synovial fluid analysis?"

Could it have been a simple sprain or another type of inflammatory arthritis that resolved spontaneously? It seems unusual for an inflammatory arthritis to resolve so quickly without treatment. Also, regarding the reactive arthritis hypothesis, should we consider other less common infectious triggers beyond the ones we've already discussed? For example, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* or *Chlamydia pneumoniae* can sometimes trigger reactive arthritis. Would you recommend testing for these as well, or should we wait for the initial results before broadening the infectious workup?

Given the chronicity of four months, a parasitic infection, like Giardia, is a stronger possibility than a typical viral gastroenteritis. While bacterial causes are also possible, the absence of blood makes some of the more invasive bacterial infections less likely. Besides the stool studies you mentioned, I think a complete blood count (CBC) would be helpful to look for any signs of inflammation or anemia. Also, considering the duration of symptoms, testing for celiac disease with tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies (tTG-IgA) might be worthwhile, even though the patient denies specific food intolerances. It could be a subclinical presentation triggered by something they ate on the trip.

While the patient hasn't reported steatorrhea, it might be subtle and could point towards a malabsorption issue, perhaps exacerbated by the potential infection. Also, regarding the hydrogen breath test, would you prefer lactose or glucose as the substrate given the lack of reported lactose intolerance?

Assuming the initial tests (stool studies, CBC, tTG-IgA) are negative, and the fecal fat test and lactose breath test are also normal, would you consider a trial of a low FODMAP diet to see if there's any improvement in the patient's symptoms? This could help us assess for potential IBS, even though the mucus in the stool points away from that diagnosis. Also, if we do decide on empiric Giardia treatment, what regimen would you recommend?

A full colonoscopy might be considered later, but the flexible sigmoidoscopy is less invasive and a good starting point given the predominantly left lower quadrant discomfort. Before we conclude, I have a few more clarifying questions: 1. Regarding the flexible sigmoidoscopy, should we also obtain biopsies even if the mucosa appears normal visually? I'm thinking this could help rule out microscopic colitis, which could present with chronic diarrhea and mucus. 2. While Giardia is high on the differential, the patient hasn't reported any fatty stools, which are somewhat characteristic of Giardia.

While a general oncologist could also be involved eventually, the presenting symptoms (abdominal swelling, shortness of breath due to pleural effusion, and the discovery of a large ovarian mass) strongly suggest a potential gynecological malignancy. A gynecologic oncologist specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system and is best equipped to diagnose and manage ovarian cancer from the outset. They are also skilled surgeons who can perform biopsies and other necessary procedures related to the ovaries. Given the strong suspicion of ovarian cancer, referring the patient directly to a gynecologic oncologist will expedite diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning."

        "text": "Doctor: Thanks for reviewing the case. We have a patient presenting with a one-month history of progressive shortness of breath, increasing abdominal girth, and now confirmed ascites and a right-sided pleural effusion. The abdominal ultrasound reveals a large right ovarian mass. Her CA-125 is normal, which is somewhat unexpected, but doesn't rule out malignancy. CBC shows a mild anemia, but WBC and platelets are within normal limits. CMP is also unremarkable. The patient denies any history of heart or lung disease, hormone replacement therapy, or oral contraceptive use. She also denies any family history of ovarian or other cancers, although we may want to explore that further. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, given the large ovarian mass and ascites. The pleural effusion also raises suspicion for metastatic spread. However, the normal CA-125 and relatively rapid onset of symptoms make me consider other possibilities. My questions for you"

No, a CT scan hasn't been ordered yet, but I'll put that in right away. A chest/abdomen/pelvis CT will be crucial for staging if it is malignant, and will also help differentiate between a fibroma and other ovarian masses. Given the pleural effusion, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a primary lung process with secondary ovarian involvement, although that seems less likely given the size of the ovarian mass. Would you recommend a thoracentesis to analyze the pleural fluid? This could help determine if the effusion is malignant or due to another cause. Furthermore, while the CA-125 is normal, it isn't definitive. Given the strong suspicion for ovarian pathology, I think a biopsy of the ovarian mass, either via image-guided core needle biopsy"

It offers the best chance for both diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. A biopsy, while less invasive, might not provide enough tissue for a definitive diagnosis, and delaying cytoreduction if it is malignant could be detrimental. I'll contact surgical oncology for a consult. Before I do, I have a couple of clarifying questions. Given the patient's relatively young age and the possibility of a benign process like a fibroma, how aggressive would surgical oncology be in terms of staging if the frozen section suggests a benign etiology? Would they still perform a full lymphadenectomy and omentectomy, or would they be more conservative? Also, what are your thoughts on preoperative tumor markers beyond CA-125, such as HE4, CEA, or InCA-1? Could these add any value in this case, even"

I agree that other tumor markers are unlikely to significantly alter management at this stage. Just to confirm my understanding, if the frozen section suggests a benign process like a fibroma, the surgical team might limit staging procedures. However, if there's any suspicion of malignancy intraoperatively, they would proceed with a full staging laparotomy including lymphadenectomy and omentectomy, correct? I want to be prepared to discuss this with the patient preoperatively so she understands the potential extent of the surgery. Also, while we suspect a primary ovarian pathology, given the pleural effusion, should we consider requesting a PET/CT scan preoperatively to definitively rule out other primary malignancies, such as a lung primary? Or would you consider that unnecessary given the current findings and the plan for surgical exploration?"

Just one final question for my own clarification: while a fibroma or other benign tumor is a possibility, given the ascites and pleural effusion, should we be preparing the patient for the possibility of a malignant diagnosis, even with a normal CA-125 and the rapid onset of symptoms? I want to ensure she's emotionally prepared for all potential outcomes. What's the typical prognosis for ovarian cancer if it's caught at this stage, assuming it is indeed malignant? And what are the next steps if the pathology does come back as malignant post-operatively?"
