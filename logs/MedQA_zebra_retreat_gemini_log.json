The patient presents with fluctuating muscle weakness, particularly impacting the proximal muscles (shoulders, upper arms, legs), along with diplopia and ptosis, all worsening with fatigue. The positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, decremental response on EMG, and absence of a thymoma on chest CT strongly suggest myasthenia gravis (MG). The normal pulmonary function test is reassuring, indicating no significant respiratory compromise at this time. My primary concern at this point is confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of the MG. While the serology and EMG are highly suggestive, I'd like your opinion on pursuing single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) for definitive confirmation, especially given the seemingly localized nature of the weakness. Do you think that's warranted in this case? Also, given the patient's description of ptosis worsening vision, I'm wondering about the extent of ocular involvement. Have you considered an ophthalmo"

Before we initiate treatment, I wanted to clarify a few points. The patient's weakness seems predominantly proximal and ocular, with no reported bulbar symptoms like dysarthria, dysphagia, or difficulty chewing. Did you notice anything in the notes to suggest otherwise? I want to ensure we haven't missed any subtle signs. Also, while the chest CT ruled out a thymoma, should we consider a thymectomy even in the absence of a visible thymoma?

First, are there any other autoimmune conditions we should consider screening for, given the presence of MG? I'm thinking particularly of thyroid disorders, which can sometimes coexist. Second, while the patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of MG, I'm always mindful of other potential mimics. Given the fluctuating nature of the weakness, conditions like Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) could be considered, though the lack of autonomic symptoms and the positive AChR antibodies make this less likely.

This would allow for a baseline assessment and expedite the process if her symptoms don't respond adequately to medical management. Also, I'm curious about your thoughts on immunosuppression. While pyridostigmine addresses the symptoms, it doesn't address the underlying autoimmune process. Would you consider adding a steroid-sparing immunosuppressant like azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil early on, or do you prefer to reserve those for patients with more severe or refractory disease?

I'm slightly concerned about the potential for perforation during the irrigation given the significant distension, so I'd like to discuss the safest approach for this. Would you recommend using a smaller catheter and proceeding slowly with saline irrigations under close monitoring? Given the baby's age (8 months), I'm wondering about the length of the aganglionic segment.

Could the underlying dysmotility associated with Hirschsprung's predispose the infant to developing a meconium plug later on, even at this age?

The workup, including the positive CD20 biopsy, strongly points towards Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). The bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. I'm particularly concerned about the patient's report of abdominal fullness and now the inability to button their pants, suggesting potential splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, which was hinted at with the earlier finding of dullness to percussion in the left lower quadrant. The PET scan, while confirming DLBCL, didn't specifically comment on the size of the spleen or liver, did it?

I also want to clarify whether the abdominal fullness is primarily due to lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or potentially ascites. Could we also check the PET for any peritoneal involvement? Beyond staging, I'm thinking about the patient's overall health and potential risk factors. While they denied any specific family history of lymphoma, it might be worth exploring any history of autoimmune disorders in the family, as these can sometimes be associated with an increased risk of lymphoma.

I want to make sure I'm palpating in the correct location. Also, regarding the mechanism, while pivoting and twisting can cause all three, is there any particular aspect of the pivoting/twisting motion (e.g., valgus stress, external rotation) that would make one more likely than the others?

However, the patient didn't report straining. * **Vasovagal syncope:** While possible, the absence of typical triggers like prolonged standing, emotional stress, or pain makes it less likely.

My initial thought is that the PDA is contributing to left-to-right shunting, leading to pulmonary overcirculation and explaining the respiratory symptoms and feeding difficulties. The reduced urine output suggests decreased renal perfusion, which could also be related to the shunting. My primary question is about the size and characteristics of the PDA on echo.

In the meantime, given the infant's symptoms (feeding fatigue, perioral cyanosis, retractions, and reduced wet diapers), I'm leaning towards treating the PDA even before getting the detailed echo findings.

Also, what parameters should I monitor closely besides renal function (BUN/Creatinine and urine output) during treatment? Should we be monitoring blood pressure, oxygen saturation continuously, and echocardiographic changes during the course of ibuprofen therapy?

The mass could be isoechoic to surrounding breast tissue, making it difficult to visualize on ultrasound. Alternatively, the mammographic finding could represent a normal variant or an area of architectural distortion rather than a true mass. The patient's description of a hard, mobile, rapidly growing mass, roughly the size of a small plum, is concerning, though.

Initially, there was mention of a palpable rectal mass, but the patient later clarified that they haven't felt any lumps or anything unusual. No pain, itching, change in bowel habits, weight loss, or mucus discharge is reported. The patient denies any family history of GI disease, recent travel, or unusual dietary intake. They also deny use of any medications, including NSAIDs. Given the bright red blood and its location on the toilet paper, the most likely source is the anorectum. My initial differential includes hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and less likely, but important to consider, rectal cancer. Given the absence of pain, hemorrhoids seem more probable than a fissure. The lack of a palpable mass and other concerning symptoms makes cancer less likely, but we can't rule it out"

Second, while the bleeding seems localized to the anorectum based on the patient's description, should we be considering any other less common diagnoses at this point, such as angiodysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease (although the lack of other symptoms makes this less likely), or ischemic colitis? While these are less probable, I want to ensure we're considering all possibilities.

Posterior hip dislocations often come with labral tears, ligamentum teres injuries, and even fractures of the posterior acetabulum or femoral head.

However, a more thorough neurological exam is warranted post-reduction to ensure no subtle deficits were missed. I'll also order knee X-rays as you suggested, to investigate the bilateral knee pain. My initial thought was a dashboard injury, but with the hip dislocation being so prominent, I didn't want to delay its management.

The abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel loops and no gas in the rectum, suggestive of a distal bowel obstruction. This was confirmed by contrast enema, which also showed a distal obstruction. My primary differential diagnoses include Hirschsprung's disease, meconium plug syndrome, meconium ileus, and less likely, an imperforate anus (though this would likely have been noticed earlier).

Before we order the MRI, could we quickly review the physical exam findings again, specifically regarding the passive range of motion at the DIP joint? If there's passive flexion present, it would further support a central slip injury as the primary issue. Also, was there any tenderness or palpable defect noted over the dorsal aspect of the DIP joint during the exam?

They are having difficulty maintaining hydration. My primary concern is the dehydration, which we are addressing with IV fluids. However, the etiology of the diarrhea remains unclear. My initial thought was antibiotic-associated diarrhea, likely due to the levofloxacin. However, the negative C. difficile test makes that less likely, though not impossible as the test isn't perfect.

We'll include that in the workup as well.

Does that level of severity typically point more towards an infectious etiology, even in the absence of other symptoms like fever? We've just received the electrolyte and BMP results. The patient is showing signs of hypokalemia and mild hyponatremia, consistent with the dehydration. BUN and creatinine are slightly elevated, likely also dehydration-related.

The patient's report of an antecedent ant bite is interesting, but the timeline and progression don't quite fit with a simple insect bite reaction. My main differential diagnoses include: 1. **Infected Diabetic Foot Ulcer:** This is my top concern given the patient's diabetes and the ulcer characteristics. The swelling in the ankles also suggests possible venous insufficiency, which could contribute. 2. **Cellulitis:** The surrounding erythema, edema, and pain are consistent with cellulitis.

However, given the patient's immunocompromised state due to diabetes, we can't entirely rule it out. I agree that wound and blood cultures are crucial. Before we settle on empiric antibiotics, I'd like to consider a few other possibilities. Could this be a form of pyoderma gangrenosum?

Would you agree with that choice, or would you prefer a different combination like cefepime and vancomycin? Also, given the patient's Crohn's disease and the consideration of pyoderma gangrenosum, should we involve a dermatologist in the case for their expertise?

While we're prepping for surgery, can we discuss anticipated intraoperative findings and potential complications? Given the potential for significant hemorrhage, what's your preferred approach to uterine repair versus hysterectomy in this scenario? Are there any specific surgical techniques you recommend considering her current state and the potential for extensive bleeding?

While the patient is on antiretroviral therapy, it's clearly not adequately controlling the virus, evidenced by the opportunistic infections. My primary concern is the rapid progression of CMV retinitis, which can lead to blindness if not treated promptly.

We have a male patient with asymmetric oligoarthritis predominantly affecting the right knee, preceded by transient left ankle monoarthritis. He also reports urethritis, conjunctivitis, and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, leukocytosis). The synovial fluid analysis further supports an inflammatory arthritis. My primary concern is reactive arthritis, likely triggered by a recent infection, possibly chlamydial given the urethritis and conjunctivitis. The HLA-B27 test, pending results, will be helpful in further risk stratification. However, I have a few questions: 1. Were the Chlamydia and Gonorrhea tests positive? This is crucial for confirming the suspected trigger. 2. What were the CRP results? While ESR is elevated, CRP can provide additional information about the degree of inflammation."

Given the patient's age and the possibility (albeit low) of a familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, BAP1 mutations could be relevant. 2. **Regarding the differential diagnosis:** While melanoma is the leading diagnosis, and we've discussed Spitz nevus and pigmented BCC, I'd like to briefly revisit the possibility of a seborrheic keratosis, particularly a large, irritated, or inflamed one.

This makes oncology the most relevant specialty for managing the patient's care going forward, which may involve surgical removal, further testing to determine the stage of the cancer, and potentially other treatments like chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy."

If the calprotectin is significantly elevated, it would strengthen the case for proceeding with the colonoscopy sooner rather than later. A couple of questions: First, regarding the potential for Giardia, would you recommend a repeat stool O&P alongside the Giardia ELISA, or do you feel the ELISA is sufficient at this point? Second, given the patient's report of incomplete evacuation, do you think we should consider pelvic floor dysfunction as a contributing factor?

Should we wait until after the colonoscopy results, or could we initiate the referral concurrently?

The ultrasound confirms the presence of a large mass on your right ovary, and it also shows a significant amount of fluid in your abdomen, which is called ascites. This explains the increased abdominal girth. The chest x-ray shows fluid around your right lung, called a pleural effusion, which is likely contributing to your shortness of breath. Your blood work shows a slightly low hemoglobin, which could also be contributing to your fatigue and shortness of breath. While your CA-125 is normal, that doesn't rule out ovarian cancer. 1.

While her CA-125 is normal, that doesn\u2019t rule out malignancy, especially given the clinical picture. My primary differential diagnosis is ovarian cancer, possibly a rapidly growing subtype. My initial thoughts are that we need to move quickly to establish a tissue diagnosis. I'd like your opinion on proceeding directly to laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy for biopsy and potential staging, versus starting with an image-guided biopsy. Given the significant ascites and pleural effusion, I'm leaning towards laparoscopy, as it would allow us to drain the fluid and obtain a good tissue sample for diagnosis. It also offers the potential to proceed with staging if the findings are concerning. What are your thoughts on the best approach for obtaining a tissue diagnosis? Also, considering"

Given her age, the rapid accumulation of ascites and pleural effusion, and the normal CA-125, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a less common malignancy, such as a germ cell tumor or a stromal tumor. While ovarian cancer is still high on my differential, these other possibilities warrant consideration. Do you agree? Also, before we proceed with laparoscopy, would you recommend any additional imaging, such as a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, to better characterize the mass and assess for any lymphadenopathy or other metastatic disease?

Since her shortness of breath seems to be her most pressing symptom, and it's significantly impacting her quality of life, I'm inclined to perform a thoracentesis prior to the laparoscopy, even if it's not routinely done. I believe it would optimize her respiratory status for the surgery and potentially provide us with fluid for cytology, which could offer additional diagnostic information. Do you concur? Also, given the possibility of a germ cell tumor, should we add AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH to the pre-operative blood work? These tumor markers could be helpful in differentiating between different types of ovarian malignancies.

Given the patient's age and the possibility of a germ cell tumor, should we consider fertility-sparing surgery if feasible? I understand that the extent of the disease will ultimately dictate the surgical approach, but I want to ensure we explore all options to preserve her fertility if possible. Secondly, while we're awaiting the results of the imaging and tumor markers, should we initiate any empiric treatment, such as corticosteroids for symptom management, or would it be best to wait for the definitive diagnosis?

While we've discussed the possibility of germ cell or stromal tumors, and those are important to consider, the normal CA-125 in the presence of such significant ascites and pleural effusion makes me wonder about a non-malignant process, albeit a rare one.
