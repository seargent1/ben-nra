I believe the diagnosis of exogenous ochronosis is correct, supported by the patient's history of hydroquinone cream use for two years and the biopsy findings showing the characteristic banana-shaped pigment deposits. I'd like to discuss management strategies with you. While discontinuation of the hydroquinone is obviously the first step, I'm curious about your experience with different treatment modalities for resolving the pigmentation. What has been your most successful approach in similar cases? Do you typically start with topical treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, or do you consider laser therapy as a first-line option? Also, given the patient's concern about the cosmetic appearance, what is a realistic timeframe for improvement that we can communicate to her?"

I haven't determined the patient's Fitzpatrick skin type yet, but I will make sure to assess that at the next appointment. Given her description of her natural skin tone and the fact that she was using a skin lightening cream, I suspect she is likely a Fitzpatrick III or IV. I'll confirm this to tailor the laser therapy appropriately and minimize the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Before we settle on the combination therapy, are there any other topical agents besides retinoids that you've found beneficial in these cases? I'm thinking specifically of hydroquinone alternatives for hyperpigmentation, such as azelaic acid, kojic acid, or vitamin C. Would these be worth considering in conjunction with the retinoids and peels, or would they be redundant? Also, in your experience, what degree of improvement can patients realistically expect?

I appreciate the confirmation that azelaic acid, kojic acid, and vitamin C can be used alongside retinoids \u2013 I was wondering about potential redundancy or interactions. Before we conclude, I have a couple of final questions. First, given the chronic nature of exogenous ochronosis and the potential for slow improvement, what strategies do you recommend for managing patient expectations and adherence to the treatment plan? It seems crucial to emphasize the long-term nature of therapy from the outset. Second, are there any specific contraindications or precautions we should be aware of when combining these various treatment modalities (retinoids, peels, lasers, and the adjunctive topical agents)? For example, should we avoid combining certain peels with specific lasers,"

One final question \u2013 are there any specific blood tests or other investigations you would recommend in this case, beyond the biopsy which has already confirmed the diagnosis? I'm thinking specifically about ruling out any underlying metabolic or endocrine disorders, even though the patient's history doesn't suggest any. While exogenous ochronosis is clearly linked to the hydroquinone use, I want to be thorough and ensure we're not missing any contributing factors. Would you recommend checking thyroid function, liver function, or any other specific markers?"

The most concerning aspect is the constellation of these symptoms, particularly given the epidemiological link to Brazil.

The peripheral eosinophilia on the CBC is also a clue that points towards some kind of inflammatory or possibly parasitic process.

Have you considered hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP)? While less common, it can present with similar radiological findings, and we haven't explored occupational or hobby-related exposures in detail. Pulmonary function tests will be crucial in differentiating between restrictive and obstructive patterns, which will help narrow down the ILD differentials. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) might also be necessary to assess the cellular composition and look for specific pathogens or evidence of alveolar proteinosis.

While the abdominal CT scan was normal, and liver function tests are unremarkable, the patient's description of discomfort worsening after eating and now localized to the left upper quadrant raises suspicion for splenic involvement, even in the absence of splenomegaly on the CT. My primary concern is that the initial CT scan, while helpful, may have missed subtle splenic involvement. Given the aggressive nature of IVLBCL and the patient's persistent symptoms despite normal imaging and lab work, I'm hesitant to simply observe. I have a few questions for you: 1.

To answer your question, a bone marrow biopsy has not yet been performed. I was holding off on that pending further investigation of the abdominal discomfort, as I wanted to rule out other potential causes before proceeding with more invasive procedures. Now that we're leaning towards splenic involvement, I'll schedule the bone marrow biopsy as well. Before we proceed, I have a couple more questions: 1. Given the patient's initial presentation with skin involvement, should we consider a skin biopsy for further evaluation, even though the diagnosis has been established via the initial biopsy?

If the PET/CT *does* reveal splenic involvement, even if it's subtle, would you still advise against splenectomy and proceed directly with R-CHOP, trusting that the chemotherapy will address the splenic involvement and alleviate the associated symptoms?

This aligns well with the patient's symptoms. My current working diagnosis is constrictive pericarditis, but I'd like to explore a few other possibilities and gather more information. First, given the patient's fatigue, I'm wondering about the possibility of hypothyroidism, though this wouldn't fully explain the fluid retention and shortness of breath.

This is somewhat unusual, but not unheard of in constrictive pericarditis. Before we review the echo images, I'd like to propose a couple of additional points. First, while rare, it's worth considering restrictive cardiomyopathy in the differential. The symptoms can mimic constrictive pericarditis, and while the catheterization findings are more suggestive of pericarditis, a detailed look at the echo, particularly diastolic function and tissue Doppler velocities, could help differentiate the two.

This gradual onset and progression seem more typical of constrictive pericarditis. Restrictive cardiomyopathy, while it can be insidious, often presents with a more rapid decline. Do you agree with this assessment of the timeline's significance? Also, I'm curious about the patient's occupational history and any potential exposures to environmental toxins or asbestos, which, albeit rare, can contribute to pericardial disease.

She has a constellation of symptoms highly suggestive of systemic sclerosis, particularly diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, yet many of the key diagnostic tests have come back normal. To recap, she presents with a three-year history of a pruritic, raised rash with a characteristic triphasic color change (white, blue, then red) triggered by cold or stress, consistent with Raynaud's. She also reports skin thickening, particularly on her hands, with resulting contractures affecting her fingers. Dysphagia, paresthesias, and a burning sensation in her hands are also present, along with hand weakness. She experiences occasional diarrhea. These symptoms have all been progressively worsening over the three-year period. Despite this compelling clinical picture, her ANA, anti-centromere, and anti-Scl-70 antibodies are negative."

Perhaps we should consider a more specific type of skin biopsy, looking for deeper dermal and fascial involvement? A deep punch biopsy or even a small fascial biopsy could help differentiate between scleroderma, where we'd expect to see fibrosis extending into the deeper layers, and eosinophilic fasciitis, which primarily affects the fascia.

The negative TB skin test also makes TB less likely.

Given that the patient's systemic symptoms are quite pronounced, I'm still wondering if we should consider other less common causes of pulmonary eosinophilia, even while prioritizing HP.

This patient presents with progressive bilateral blurry vision described as a \"hazy film,\" worsening over the past six months, with more significant decline in the last two. They also report dry eyes and a peculiar \"dip\" in their lower eyelids, which sounds like eyelid retraction. Interestingly, they had full-thickness corneal transplants about ten years ago, with no significant complications reported until now. All their bloodwork, including thyroid panel and metabolic panel, came back normal. My primary concern, given the history of corneal transplants, is endothelial graft failure. The timeframe of 10 years post-transplant, combined with the progressive blurry vision and dry eyes, makes this a strong possibility. The hazy vision description also fits this picture. I'd like your expert opinion on this. Specifically, what further investigations would you recommend to confirm or rule out endothelial graft failure?

In addition to the ART regimen and travel history, I think it would be helpful to get a more detailed sexual history, including the type of sexual practices the patient engages in.

A pathergy test could be helpful, but I'd prefer to wait on that until we have more information, as it's not very specific and could be confounded by other inflammatory processes. I'm increasingly concerned about the possibility of a less common infection or an unusual presentation of a more common one, given the patient's HIV status and the persistence of ulcers despite ART. The biopsy findings are also pushing me in that direction. So, to summarize the plan, we need the following: 1. **Patient's current ART regimen and duration:** This is crucial for ruling out DRESS and for overall management. 2. **Detailed sexual history:** Including types of sexual practices, number of partners, and history of STIs. 3. **Travel history:** Specifically to areas endemic for *Mycobacterium ulcerans"

The suggestion about trauma is also helpful, as that could certainly complicate the picture or even be the primary driver if there's a superimposed infection. So, to refine our diagnostic approach and ensure we haven't missed anything, I'd like to propose the following expanded list of questions for the patient: 1. **ART Regimen:** Can you please tell us the exact names and dosages of your HIV medications, and how long you've been on this specific regimen? 2. **Sexual History:** * Could you describe your sexual practices, including vaginal, anal (receptive or insertive), and oral sex? * How many sexual partners have you had in the past year? In the past five years? * Have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections? 3. **Trauma History:** Have you experienced any trauma"

While a dermatologist could address the skin sores, the patient's confirmed HIV status, the recurring nature of the sores despite antiviral medication, and the need to determine the exact cause of the ulcers point to a complex interaction between the patient's immune system and a likely infectious agent. Infectious disease specialists are experts in managing infections in patients with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV. They are best equipped to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the sores, considering the patient's overall health status. The sores themselves are likely a manifestation of an opportunistic infection or a complication related to the HIV infection, making an infectious disease specialist the most qualified to provide comprehensive care."
