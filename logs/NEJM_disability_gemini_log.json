While rosacea is a possible diagnosis, the patient's use of a skin-lightening cream (hydroquinone) for melasma and the subsequent development of redness and irritation suggest a potential adverse reaction or complication related to this topical treatment. A dermatologist specializes in diagnosing and treating skin conditions, including melasma, rosacea, and contact dermatitis (which could be caused by the hydroquinone).

However, the history of using a hydroquinone cream for two years, coupled with the patient's report that the irritation started after using the cream, raises a red flag. While rosacea is still a possibility, we need to consider other diagnoses, particularly those related to the hydroquinone use. My primary concern is exogenous ochronosis, a paradoxical darkening of the skin that can occur with long-term hydroquinone use, especially in darker skin types. It can also present with erythema and a burning sensation. I'd like to know more about the patient's skin type (Fitzpatrick scale) to assess this risk. Secondly, contact dermatitis, either irritant or allergic, is possible. While the delayed onset of symptoms after starting the hydroquinone is less typical for allergic contact dermatitis"

However, I'm still hesitant about reintroducing hydroquinone even in the triple combination cream, given the patient's history and the suspected exogenous ochronosis. While I understand it can be effective for melasma, wouldn't we risk exacerbating the ochronosis or potentially inducing it again even after it improves? Are there other alternatives we could consider for the melasma that don't involve hydroquinone, such as continuing the tranexamic acid or azelaic acid, or perhaps adding other topical agents like kojic acid or niacinamide?

If the spirometry, CXR, PPI, and antihistamine trials are all unrevealing, what would be our next steps? Would you consider a cough hypersensitivity test or a bronchoscopy at that point? Also, should we consider a trial of inhaled corticosteroids, even with the lack of asthma symptoms, or would you prefer to wait and see if anything shows up on the spirometry first"

Could the immunohistochemical profile help differentiate between IVLBCL and primary cutaneous lymphomas like leg type or follicle center? Also, while the patient denies bone pain, should we consider a skeletal survey or bone scintigraphy given the possibility of bone marrow involvement, especially with such a high LDH?

Should we consider flow cytometry and cytogenetics on the bone marrow aspirate in addition to the standard histopathology? This could be helpful in further characterizing the lymphoma cells and identifying any specific genetic abnormalities, which could have prognostic and therapeutic implications. Secondly, while we are prioritizing IVLBCL, the extremely high LDH and rapid progression make me want to be thorough in ruling out other aggressive lymphomas.

Initially, heart failure seemed the most likely diagnosis. However, the chest radiograph showing pericardial calcification and the hemodynamic findings of ventricular interdependence and discordant pressure tracings from the simultaneous right and left heart catheterization clearly point towards constrictive pericarditis. The patient denies any history of chest infections, trauma, radiation therapy, tuberculosis, inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, kidney problems, or international travel.

First, while the asbestos exposure makes it the most likely culprit, are there any other less common causes of constrictive pericarditis we should consider, even with her negative history for the more typical etiologies? I'm thinking specifically about prior viral pericarditis that she may not recall, or even something like hypothyroidism, though I acknowledge that's a long shot. Second, I'm curious about the degree of functional impairment. Have we quantified her exercise tolerance with something like a six-minute walk test?

Regarding occult malignancy, are there any specific tumor markers you'd recommend checking, given her presentation? Also, given the chronicity of her symptoms, I'm wondering about the potential for any underlying nutritional deficiencies.

Given the patient's history of asbestos exposure, and although it's less likely given the localized nature of her symptoms, should we consider mesothelioma as a remote possibility? While the imaging and hemodynamics strongly suggest constrictive pericarditis, I want to ensure we've considered all potential differentials related to asbestos exposure.

It's more noticeable in person than in the photos, but I wanted to mention it. Does that suggest anything in particular? I'm also still concerned about the dysphagia and the hand symptoms. Even if we find something like hypothyroidism or an abnormal lipid panel, would those fully explain this constellation of symptoms? I'm wondering if we should consider a referral to gastroenterology for the dysphagia, and perhaps neurology for the burning/numbness in the hands, to get their perspectives.

I agree it wouldn't explain the full picture, especially the dysphagia and the more diffuse skin thickening beyond the yellowish plaques. The lipid panel results are back, and they show significantly elevated triglycerides and cholesterol, particularly the VLDL fraction. This certainly supports the idea of a lipid deposition process contributing to the yellowish hue. Given these results, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of **primary hyperlipidemia with eruptive xanthomas**, potentially exacerbating an underlying inflammatory skin condition like seborrheic dermatitis, which could explain the greasy feel and more widespread rash. The dysphagia and hand symptoms are still puzzling, though. Could the hyperlipidemia be contributing to peripheral neuropathy, explaining the burning and numbness in her hands?

She experiences morning stiffness and a sensation of instability, particularly going downstairs. The pain is localized above the patella with a feeling of a \"gap.\" Importantly, she's on dialysis for chronic kidney disease, which raises some red flags. My initial thought is osteoarthritis, potentially exacerbated by her underlying renal condition. The pain location, stiffness, and functional limitations are consistent with this.

Also, given the patient's age and the bilateral nature of the symptoms, should we consider inflammatory arthritis in the differential, even though she doesn't report redness or warmth?

Or would you recommend waiting to see if the itching resolves with the antiviral and addressing it specifically if it persists?

Also, while I understand the rationale for the HIV test, are there any other immunodeficiency states you think are worth considering given the prolonged course of shingles, perhaps something less common than HIV? For example, should we consider testing for immunoglobulin levels or complement deficiencies? Finally, given the localized nature of the zoster, is it less likely to be related to a systemic immunodeficiency? I understand a disseminated zoster would be more concerning in that regard, but this seems quite localized to a single dermatome. I just want to be thorough and ensure we aren't missing anything."

Given the potential for rapid vision loss with any of these conditions, I'm referring the patient for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation, including dilated fundus exam, tonometry, and potentially B-scan ultrasound. I'll specifically ask the ophthalmologist to assess for granulomatous uveitis, periphlebitis, choroidal lesions (for sarcoid), optic nerve"

The key findings are the anemia with evidence of hemolysis (red blood cell destruction) on the CBC and the positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT).

No recent travel, no known liver disease or blood disorders, and no other significant medication history. My initial thought is drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIHA) given the ibuprofen use, but the normal liver function tests and urinalysis make me wonder if we're missing something.

The normal urinalysis is somewhat atypical for typical warm antibody IMHA, and while not always present, dark urine due to hemoglobinuria is more common in warm AIHA.

Also, while the patient denies any recent travel, I'd like to clarify their travel history a bit further.

Also, regarding the bacterial culture, should we target any specific organisms given his COPD history? H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are common in COPD exacerbations, but I'm wondering if there are other organisms we should consider in this context of chronic laryngitis.

While initial tests for common STIs like herpes and syphilis were negative, the biopsy results, coupled with the patient's HIV-positive status, strongly suggest an infectious etiology. The doctor even suspects chancroid, another STI. Managing HIV and its related complications, as well as diagnosing and treating less common STIs like chancroid, falls squarely within the expertise of an Infectious Disease specialist. They are best equipped to handle the complexities of the patient's case, including potential drug interactions and opportunistic infections."
