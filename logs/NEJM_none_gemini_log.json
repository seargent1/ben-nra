I'm fairly certain this is exogenous ochronosis due to the long-term hydroquinone use, confirmed by the biopsy showing the characteristic banana-shaped pigment deposits. However, I wanted to consult with you on a few points. First, while the patient states she used a 2% hydroquinone cream, purchased over-the-counter, is it possible she could have unknowingly used a stronger concentration? Sometimes products sold in less regulated settings may contain higher concentrations than advertised. Could this explain the relatively rapid onset within a year? Second, are there any other conditions that could mimic exogenous ochronosis that we should consider, even with the positive biopsy? I'm thinking particularly about conditions like melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, although the bluish-grey hue and the biopsy findings make these less likely. Third, what is your preferred approach to managing exogenous ochronosis? The patient is keen to explore treatment options"

Did the patient mention any potential exposure to specific chemicals or drugs that could be implicated in Riehl's melanosis or drug-induced pigmentation? I don't recall seeing anything in her history, but it's worth double-checking. Also, with Riehl's melanosis, wouldn't we expect more of a reticular pattern, rather than the diffuse hyperpigmentation she presents with? Finally, regarding the treatment plan, do you have a preferred sequence or combination of the retinoids, peels, and lasers?

One final question regarding the differential diagnosis: Given the \"muddy brown, almost grayish\" description of the pigmentation, and the relatively rapid onset, could this also suggest a possibility of erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP), also known as ashy dermatosis? I understand it's more common on the trunk and extremities, but it can occur on the face.

I'll discontinue the patient's use of the skin-lightening cream and initiate the treatment plan you suggested, starting with topical retinoids and then considering peels and lasers as needed. I'll also counsel the patient about the potential for incomplete resolution of the pigmentation, even with treatment. Just to be absolutely thorough, and for my own learning, are there any specific histological features, besides the banana-shaped bodies, that you would look for to definitively differentiate ochronosis from conditions like Riehl's melanosis or drug-induced pigmentation, should they present with similar clinical features? For example, are there specific differences in the distribution or type of pigment deposition, or any accompanying inflammatory changes, that could help distinguish them under the microscope?"

Is that correct? And one final question, regarding the patient's prognosis: While we've discussed the possibility of incomplete resolution, are there any factors that might predict a better or worse response to treatment in exogenous ochronosis? For instance, does the duration of hydroquinone use, the concentration used (assuming we can accurately determine it), or the patient's skin type influence the likelihood of improvement with the treatments we've discussed?

We have a young patient, recently immigrated from Brazil, presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy, intermittent fevers, weight loss, and peripheral eosinophilia. The lymph node biopsy and ultrasound were normal, which is throwing me off. My initial concern, given the travel history and eosinophilia, was a parasitic infection, perhaps something like Chagas disease or toxoplasmosis. However, the normal lymph node biopsy makes those less likely, although not impossible. My primary question revolves around the characterization of the lymphadenopathy as \"squishy lumps.\" Can you elaborate on the ultrasound findings? Were the nodes homogenous? Was there any evidence of necrosis or calcification? Also, while the biopsy was normal, was it specifically examined for parasites? Standard H&E staining might miss them.

However, given the patient's origin, it's definitely worth investigating. Could we also discuss the possibility of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)? While the Monospot test wasn't mentioned in the initial notes, it should be performed, or repeated if already done. The intermittent fevers and lymphadenopathy could fit the picture.

They also deny any significant environmental exposures, recent medication changes, or history of allergies, though they haven't had allergy testing. Notably, they deny symptoms suggestive of GERD, though a trial of PPI was suggested. Given the radiological findings, I'm concerned about interstitial lung disease (ILD). The crazy paving pattern specifically raises the possibility of conditions like nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or even acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), though the chronicity"

We've ruled out a number of potential causes for the pericardial thickening including prior cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, infection (patient denies history of TB or recent infections), and autoimmune disease. Kidney function appears to be normal based on the patient's history. My primary concern is the chronicity of the symptoms \u2013 three years of progressive dyspnea and bloating.

A right heart catheterization would indeed be the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis if the MRI findings are equivocal. Before we proceed, I'd like to discuss a few points: 1. **Regarding the normal BNP:** While not typical in constrictive pericarditis, it's important to remember that BNP levels can be influenced by various factors, including renal function and obesity. Although the patient doesn't report any kidney issues and we have normal CMP results, it's worth double-checking their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to ensure we aren't missing subtle renal dysfunction. Could we also get a measure of their BMI? 2. **Differential Diagnosis:** While constrictive pericarditis seems most likely, given the chronicity and relatively mild symptoms, could we consider other conditions that might mimic"

I'll also ask about recent infections and travel history, though we've already touched on this briefly and the patient denied any recent illnesses. Regarding right heart failure from other causes, what are your thoughts on ordering a D-dimer to assess for the possibility of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), albeit a less likely scenario? The patient's chronic dyspnea could potentially fit, though the absence of leg swelling argues against it. In terms of restrictive cardiomyopathy, are there any specific subtypes you think are more likely given the presentation?

Regarding the cardiac MRI, should we consider any specific sequences or protocols beyond the standard assessment of pericardial thickness and morphology? For instance, would late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) be helpful in differentiating between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, or in identifying any myocardial involvement in the case of sarcoidosis or amyloidosis?

The initial presentation suggested scleroderma, with the Raynaud's phenomenon, skin thickening, and dysphagia. However, the negative ANA and Scl-70 antibodies, along with the monoclonal gammopathy found on further testing, complicate the picture. While the patient denies bone pain, recurrent infections, and unusual bruising/bleeding, the gammopathy raises a flag for potential hematologic involvement. My current leading differential diagnoses include: 1. **Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma:** As you know, this variant presents with systemic features of scleroderma but without the characteristic skin tightening. The patient's Raynaud's, dysphagia, and possible nail thickening fit this picture. The fatigue and weight loss could also be attributed to systemic involvement.

I'll admit, I was initially focused on scleroderma and its variants, and may have anchored on that. The description of the rash as \"bumpy\" and \"greasy-feeling\" wasn't classic for scleroderma, and I may have overlooked the urticarial aspect. To answer your question, a nailfold capillaroscopy hasn't been performed yet. I'll order that along with the tests you suggested.

Given the linear distribution and the patient's description of the lesions as \"craters,\" herpes simplex seems less probable, wouldn't you agree? Also, the lack of response to hydrocortisone cream argues against contact dermatitis, although we can't entirely rule it out. Regarding the capsaicin cream, I'm a little hesitant to prescribe it right away, given the patient's already intense pruritus. Could the capsaicin exacerbate the itching initially before providing relief? Perhaps a topical anesthetic like lidocaine might be a better option for immediate symptom control, in conjunction with the antiviral?

While shingles is typically self-limiting, I want to ensure we haven't overlooked anything, especially given the duration of symptoms (four months). Also, while less likely, could the prolonged duration and spreading nature of the rash suggest a possible immunocompromised state?

I'm curious about your thoughts on the possibility of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) developing in this patient, given the prolonged duration of symptoms already. Should we consider prophylactic measures for PHN alongside the antiviral treatment, or is it best to wait and see how the patient responds to the valacyclovir first? If we do opt for prophylaxis, what would you recommend? Also, while the rash is currently limited to the back, should we discuss the potential for ophthalmic zoster with the patient, given the possibility of it spreading?

However, the sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli came back negative. The chest x-ray showed upper lobe\u2013predominant peripheral and subpleural consolidations, sparing the perihilar region, which while not typical for TB, didn't rule it out.

While the patient hasn't reported any specific upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms like sinusitis, rhinitis, or neuropathy, which are often present in EGPA, the absence of these doesn't exclude the diagnosis. Given the patient's significant weight loss, should we also consider obtaining a serum ACE level to evaluate for sarcoidosis, even though the chest x-ray findings aren't typical? While sarcoidosis often presents with hilar adenopathy, it can occasionally manifest with upper lobe predominant disease.

One question I have is about the patient's relatively long duration of symptoms (three months). While EGPA can certainly present with a subacute or chronic course, is this duration typical? I'm also wondering if the initial presentation with prominent systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, and night sweats, is more suggestive of an infectious etiology, even with the negative initial AFB smear. Should we consider broadening the infectious workup further, perhaps including testing for less common fungal pathogens or even parasitic infections, given the eosinophilia?

I\u2019m still somewhat hesitant to fully attribute the systemic symptoms, particularly the fever, chills, night sweats, and weight loss, solely to asthma, even with an eosinophilic component. While these can occur in severe exacerbations, they are unusual. Given the three-month duration and the upper lobe predominance on the chest x-ray, I\u2019m leaning towards a process like EGPA or an infectious etiology, even with the negative initial AFB smear.

I agree that they are less likely given the specific eyelid findings, but worth keeping in mind. I haven't specifically asked the patient if the blur improves with rest, but I will inquire about that at our next appointment. Does the fact that the eyelid issue is described as a \"dent\" or inward pulling, rather than traditional ptosis, make you lean towards or away from any particular diagnoses in the myasthenia gravis spectrum? Also, are there any specific blood tests beyond the acetylcholine receptor antibody test that you would recommend at this stage, perhaps to further investigate the possibility of LEMS or other myopathies, even if they are less likely? Finally, if the orbital CT comes back normal, what would be your next step in investigating this case?"

However, given the patient's primary complaint is blurry vision, with the eyelid changes being a secondary observation, I'm still hesitant to jump straight to these tests without exploring other potential causes of visual disturbance. Before we proceed with the Tensilon test or EMG, could we consider checking for dry eye, even though the patient denies dryness symptoms? Sometimes subtle dry eye can manifest as blurry vision, and it's a relatively simple evaluation. Perhaps a Schirmer's test or tear film osmolarity test could be helpful.

Perhaps their blurry vision is actually a very mild, transient diplopia that resolves quickly. Could we consider a Hess screen test to evaluate for subtle extraocular muscle imbalances, even in the absence of reported diplopia?

A gastroenterologist is the specialist equipped to diagnose and manage conditions affecting these organs."

They also deny any history of trauma, infection, kidney stones, relevant family history, or exposure to chemicals. They are otherwise healthy and report no systemic symptoms like fever, chills, weight loss, jaundice, or unexplained bruising. We're waiting on the abdominal/pelvic CT scan, and a cystoscopy is planned pending those results. My primary concern, given the painless hematuria, is a potential urothelial malignancy.

They do play soccer, and I wonder if there could be some sort of chronic irritation or inflammation related to that activity. What are your thoughts on ordering a urine cytology along with the pending CT scan? I'm leaning towards that to further evaluate for malignancy given the persistent hematuria.

Just to be absolutely thorough, and considering his history of heavy smoking, even though it was ten years ago, could we consider the possibility of malignancy, however remote, in the differential diagnosis? While the biopsy suggests candidiasis, the white plaques could potentially mask an underlying lesion. Would you recommend any further investigation in this direction, perhaps a repeat biopsy after the antifungal treatment, or closer monitoring for recurrence after the initial treatment course?

I'll schedule that. I also agree that a drug reaction is less likely given the year-long history, but I'll keep it in mind. Regarding the ART regimen, besides confirming the medications and adherence, I'd like to also check his HIV genotype resistance testing history. Knowing if he has any known resistance mutations will help us tailor his therapy if needed. Has he had any genotype testing done recently? Also, while we're broadening the differential, should we consider atypical mycobacterial infections, particularly given his HIV status and the ulcerative presentation with epidermal necrosis on biopsy? While less common, they can cause cutaneous lesions and could be contributing to the overall clinical picture. Finally, to clarify the timeline, did the genital ulcers predate his HIV diagnosis, or"

I'll also ask him specifically about the timeline of his HIV diagnosis in relation to the onset of the genital ulcers. That will help clarify whether these lesions predated his immunocompromised state or emerged afterward, which will significantly influence our diagnostic approach. Regarding travel history, I haven't asked him about that specifically yet. I'll add that to my list of questions for the next appointment. It's worth exploring if he's traveled to regions where infections like leishmaniasis or other endemic diseases are more prevalent, as these could mimic his presentation. Given the broadening differential, and while we await further test results, should we consider starting empiric treatment for any of the suspected infections, or would you recommend holding off until we have more definitive data? I'm leaning towards waiting for more information before initiating treatment to avoid"

I also wanted to clarify a few points and add some additional considerations: 1. **Regarding the biopsy:** While a dermatology referral is pending, I'm curious if special stains were used on the biopsy specimen, such as those for fungal elements, acid-fast bacilli (for mycobacteria), or Warthin-Starry silver stain (for donovanosis)? This could provide valuable information while we await the second opinion. 2. **Sexual history:** While we've discussed the number of partners, I need to clarify the types of sexual practices he engages in. This will help further refine the risk assessment for certain STIs. For example, does he engage in receptive or insertive anal intercourse? This information is crucial for assessing risk for LGV, syphilis, and other infections."

While the initial suspicion might be herpes, the patient's confirmed HIV-positive status adds another layer of complexity. Infectious disease specialists are experts in managing both HIV and other co-occurring infections, including STIs like herpes and syphilis (which is still being investigated). They are best equipped to interpret the patient's overall clinical picture, including CD4 count, viral load, and the impact of HIV on the presentation and treatment of other infections. Additionally, they can assess the patient's current ART regimen and make adjustments if necessary, especially considering the patient admits to occasionally missing doses. The biopsy results, indicating epidermal necrosis and inflammation, further support the need for an ID specialist's expertise."
