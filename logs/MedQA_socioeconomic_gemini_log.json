The fluctuating muscle weakness affecting the ocular, bulbar, and limb muscles, combined with the positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, strongly supports this diagnosis. The worsening of symptoms with activity and improvement with rest (as described by the patient) further solidifies the diagnosis. The absence of a thymoma on the chest CT scan is also noted. While the presentation is highly suggestive of MG, I'd like to discuss a few points and potential next steps: 1. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):** Although less likely given the prominent ocular involvement and the positive AChR antibodies, LEMS should be considered in the differential. Could we discuss the possibility of adding a voltage-gated calcium channel antibody test to further differentiate?

However, that's a good point and I will add that to the follow-up questions. I agree that testing for voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies is a reasonable next step to definitively rule out LEMS. Before starting pyridostigmine, I'd like to get a clearer picture of the severity of the patient's symptoms, particularly the bulbar symptoms like swallowing difficulties. Are there any specific tests or scales you recommend for assessing the severity of MG, such as the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification or the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score?

Given the swallowing difficulties, I'm slightly concerned about the potential for aspiration, especially as the patient mentioned difficulty with thicker foods. Would you recommend a swallowing evaluation by a speech therapist at this stage, or should we monitor the response to pyridostigmine first and consider the evaluation if swallowing issues persist or worsen? Also, while the chest CT ruled out a thymoma, should we consider a thymectomy even in the absence of a thymoma, given the patient's age (which I haven't explicitly stated but should obtain) and the potential long-term benefits? I understand the evidence is somewhat mixed, but I'd like to discuss the pros and cons in this specific case. Finally"

The patient's history of Crohn's and natalizumab use for approximately one year further solidifies this.

First, I'm concerned about the lack of JC virus screening prior to initiating natalizumab. Was this documented anywhere in their records?

The MRI report mentioned multifocal lesions; do you think it's worth reviewing the imaging ourselves to see if there's any particular lesion distribution that might explain the laterality of the symptoms?

Even the rectal biopsy, initially suggestive of Hirschsprung's, came back normal. My initial concern, given the barium enema findings, was Hirschsprung's disease. However, the normal rectal biopsy throws that into question. We've ruled out other organic causes like cystic fibrosis, intestinal obstruction, and infections through the various tests. The normal ultrasound also makes structural abnormalities less likely. Given the normal findings on extensive testing, I'm leaning towards a"

However, the mother reports the infant *doesn't* strain much and doesn't poop very often, which seems to contradict the typical presentation of dyschezia. While the fussiness with feeding could be related to discomfort from gas or distension, the reported weight *gain* is unusual for dyschezia, where infants often maintain weight but may not thrive optimally. Furthermore, the significant abdominal distension and pain, particularly in the LLQ, are more worrisome than what's usually seen in simple dyschezia. To answer your question, no, probiotics haven't been tried, and a stool study for microbiota hasn't been done. I'm hesitant to jump to those interventions before we have a clearer understanding of the underlying issue. While a microbiota imbalance could contribute to symptoms, it seems less likely to be the"

Usually, infants with food intolerances experience poor weight gain or even failure to thrive due to malabsorption and decreased intake related to discomfort. Also, while LLQ pain isn't unheard of in food allergies, it's not the most common presentation. I'd expect more diffuse abdominal pain or discomfort. Before we consider a trial elimination diet or hypoallergenic formula, I'd like to explore a couple of other avenues. First, given the LLQ pain and the initial, albeit misleading, barium enema result, I'd like to revisit the possibility of Hirschsprung's disease, despite the normal rectal biopsy.

Regarding chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), while the weight gain is atypical, I'm open to exploring this further. Are there any specific subtypes of CIPO that might present with weight gain, or any other features that we should be looking for in this patient?

The patient denies any recent travel or ill contacts, but could we consider testing for things like HIV, CMV, or EBV, especially given the generalized lymphadenopathy and B symptoms?

While the CT didn't show any obvious masses, the patient's description of thinner, darker stools, persistent fullness, and change in bowel habits suggests something might be happening in the GI tract. Could the enlarged mesenteric nodes be obscuring a smaller lesion, or could there be something affecting the small bowel that isn't readily visible on CT?

The sharp, medial knee pain, worsened by weight-bearing and flexion/extension, along with the reported instability (\"wobbly\" sensation), further supports these diagnoses. The lack of swelling and bruising isn't unusual in the acute phase, especially with a meniscus tear. My differential also includes patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), given the location of the pain below the kneecap. However, the mechanism of injury and the instability make this less likely.

The patient mentioned inconsistent warm-up routines lately. Could this lack of proper preparation have predisposed them to this injury?

I'm leaning towards a hinged brace to control valgus stress, especially if the MRI reveals a meniscus tear. 2. Regarding physical therapy, should we focus on strengthening specific muscle groups preemptively, even before the MRI results? I'm thinking quadriceps and hamstring strengthening to provide better knee stability. Are there any other specific exercises or modalities you'd recommend at this stage? 3.

While the patient reported no prodrome or post-ictal confusion, which makes a seizure less likely, I think it's worth investigating further given the potential consequences if missed. Beyond the Holter monitor and clarifying witness observations, are there any other cardiac investigations you'd recommend at this stage, given the normal EKG and initial blood work? For example, would a tilt table test be helpful in assessing for orthostatic hypotension or neurocardiogenic syncope, even though the patient denies getting up quickly?

While phyllodes tumors are typically benign, they can be borderline or malignant, and rapid growth is a concerning feature. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is between a benign and a malignant phyllodes tumor. Less likely, but still on the differential, are other rapidly growing sarcomas, such as a malignant fibrous histiocytoma or liposarcoma, although these are less common in the breast.

Could a hormonal profile be helpful at this stage, or should we wait for the core biopsy results and IHC stains before considering that? Also, while the initial biopsy showed leaf-like structures, is there a chance the initial sample might have missed a more aggressive component if there's a mixed pathology?

Should I try a topical treatment for hemorrhoids before the colonoscopy, or would you prefer to proceed directly to the colonoscopy given his age and the need to definitively rule out other causes? Also, given his average fiber intake and moderate water consumption, could these be contributing factors? Should I recommend increasing his fiber and fluid intake regardless of the underlying cause?"

We have a young patient with acute onset pain and swelling in the right ring finger DIP joint following a football injury two days prior. The pain is sharp, throbbing, 7/10 at rest, worsening to 8-9/10 with movement or contact. He reports stiffness and limited range of motion, particularly at the DIP, with purplish discoloration around the joint. No numbness or tingling reported. X-ray is negative for fracture or dislocation, but shows soft tissue swelling around the DIP. He denies any prior finger injuries or history of arthritis. No other recent stressors besides the football game were identified. He denies any current medications or supplements. My initial differential includes a mallet finger, a volar plate injury, or a distal phalanx fracture that isn't visible on the initial X-ray (occult fracture).

I haven't specifically tested active DIP extension yet, but given his reported inability to bend the tip of his finger and the stiffness, I suspect it will be significantly limited or absent. I agree that mallet finger and occult fracture are high on the differential. A volar plate injury seems less likely given the lack of significant hyperextension injury and the location of the swelling and pain. My main concern is differentiating between a mallet finger and an occult fracture. Would you recommend an MRI to better visualize the extensor tendon and rule out a bony avulsion fracture at this stage, or would you prefer to wait for the repeat X-ray in 10-14 days? If we splint the DIP in extension, will that adequately address both potential diagnoses in the interim? Also, should we consider a referral to hand therapy for early mobilization once the initial inflammation subsides, regardless of the final diagnosis?"

The presentation of a painful, progressively enlarging ulcerative lesion with a necrotic center, purplish border, and associated leg swelling raises several concerns. The patient's report of pain worsening with dependency and improving with elevation suggests a vascular component. The chronicity (one month duration), lack of systemic symptoms like fever and chills, and the localized nature point away from a rapidly spreading infectious process like cellulitis or necrotizing fasciitis, at least at this stage. My primary differential diagnoses include: 1. **Venous stasis ulcer:** Given the patient's leg swelling, visible varicosities, and pain relieved by elevation, this is high on the list. The ulcer's appearance is also consistent with this diagnosis. However, the purplish border and necrotic center raise the suspicion of something more. 2. **Infected venous stasis ulcer:** A secondary bacterial infection superimposed on a venous stasis ulcer is possible,"

The lesion's appearance \u2013 that purplish, undermined border \u2013 also fits that picture. However, the classic presentation of pyoderma gangrenosum often involves a more rapid progression than what we're seeing here. Also, while venous stasis ulcers are common in patients with diabetes, the patient's description of erratic blood sugar control recently makes me wonder if there's a component of diabetic foot ulcer we should consider, especially with the necrotic center.

Given the patient's Crohn's disease, I'm also wondering if we should consider other less common inflammatory skin conditions that can sometimes mimic these presentations, such as erythema nodosum or even a cutaneous manifestation of Crohn's itself. While less likely, they're worth keeping in the back of our minds. Could the recent uveitis episode be related to the current skin lesion?

While the patient doesn't have overt systemic symptoms like fever or significant weight loss, the combination of uveitis, Crohn's, and now this unusual skin lesion warrants further investigation. Given the patient's complex medical history, I'm also wondering about the possibility of an atypical infection.

Given the patient's erratic blood sugars, should we consider optimizing their diabetic management in parallel with our diagnostic workup?

That information will be crucial once she arrives at the hospital. Vasa previa is a good thought, but as you mentioned, the severe pain makes it less probable. The bleeding in vasa previa is typically painless or associated with mild discomfort, and it's often triggered by rupture of membranes. Did the patient mention anything about her water breaking? I don't recall her saying that, but it's worth clarifying with the receiving team. Given the significant bleeding, I'm also wondering about potential coagulopathy, either pre-existing and undiagnosed or developing as a complication of the abruption.

The normal CRP is somewhat unexpected in an inflammatory arthritis, but it isn't always elevated in reactive arthritis, especially early in the disease course. I'm curious about a few things.

The shortness of breath sounds like dyspnea, worse on exertion and occasionally causing nocturnal awakenings. She uses an extra pillow to sleep. The abdominal distension is associated with a feeling of fullness but no pain. No changes in bowel habits. No peripheral edema. No significant weight change, though she notes the abdominal enlargement. She denies prior heart or lung issues. Menstrual cycles have been somewhat irregular and heavier recently. Given the known ovarian mass, my primary concern is malignant ovarian cancer with possible ascites and pleural effusion contributing to the shortness of breath. The increased abdominal girth without pain, coupled with the breathing difficulties, strongly suggests fluid accumulation. The irregular and heavier periods could also be related to the ovarian pathology. However, we need to consider other possibilities. What's the size and nature of the known"

Can you order a CT of the abdomen/pelvis and chest, with and without contrast, to assess for ascites, pleural effusion, and any metastatic spread? Specifically, I'd like to see if there's any lymphadenopathy or peritoneal carcinomatosis. While ovarian cancer seems most likely, I'd like to keep a few other differentials in mind pending imaging results. Could the mass be benign, causing these symptoms due to its size and location? A large fibroma or cystadenoma, for example, could cause pressure symptoms and potentially even some pleural effusion, though that's less common.

I'm particularly concerned about the pleural effusion in the context of everything else. While a benign ovarian mass *could* theoretically cause abdominal distension and pressure symptoms, a pleural effusion is less likely with a benign etiology. Do you think we should also consider a thoracentesis if the effusion is significant on the CT? This would allow us to analyze the fluid for malignant cells and further refine our diagnosis. Additionally, it could provide symptomatic relief for her dyspnea. Regarding endometriosis, while it can cause pelvic pain and irregular bleeding, the significant abdominal distension and pleural effusion make it a less likely primary driver of her symptoms. It's possible she has both endometriosis and ovarian cancer, but the latter seems to be the more pressing concern. Once"

Do we have any information on when it was first discovered, its size at that time, and any imaging characteristics (e.g., simple cyst, complex mass, solid components)? Knowing the history of the mass might give us a better sense of the aggressiveness of the potential malignancy. Also, has she had any prior surgeries, specifically related to her ovaries or reproductive system? This information could influence our surgical approach if we need to proceed with a biopsy or debulking procedure. Finally, while we're waiting for the CT results, could we also run a complete blood count (CBC) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)? The CBC could reveal anemia, which is sometimes"

It looks like the ovarian mass was first noted on a pelvic ultrasound about six months ago during a workup for irregular bleeding. The report describes it as a complex cystic and solid mass measuring 5 cm in diameter, located on the left ovary. There was no ascites or other concerning findings at that time. No prior surgeries are documented. This relatively rapid growth over six months is concerning and further supports the possibility of malignancy. Given the new symptoms and the apparent growth of the mass, I think we need to be prepared to discuss surgical options with the patient once the CT and CA-125 results are back. If the imaging confirms ascites and pleural effusion, and the CA-125 is elevated, I think a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, and potentially debulking surgery and omentectomy, would be the next step."
