I initially suspected melasma, given the patient's presentation of facial hyperpigmentation, worsening with sun exposure, family history of similar skin changes, and female sex. However, the skin biopsy revealed extracellular deposition of yellow-brown, banana-shaped bodies in the dermis, which is pathognomonic for ochronosis. Coupled with her history of hydroquinone use, this points towards exogenous ochronosis. While she reports only two years of continuous use, she mentioned using another hydroquinone cream 10-15 years prior, albeit for a shorter, unspecified duration. I'm concerned that the cumulative hydroquinone exposure over the years has led to this condition. My main question is whether you agree with the diagnosis of exogenous ochronosis? And secondly, given the chronicity of this condition and the potential for further pigmentation even after discontinuing hydroquinone, what treatment options would you recommend?

Given that she's experiencing ochronosis after what she reports as only two years of consistent hydroquinone use, plus a shorter period many years ago, I'm wondering if she might have a genetic predisposition to this condition, or if she might be underestimating her past hydroquinone use. Is there any way to assess that predisposition? Also, while the biopsy confirmed ochronosis, are there any other tests we should consider to rule out other contributing factors or co-existing conditions? For example, could a liver function test be helpful to assess for any underlying hepatic issues that might be exacerbating the pigmentation?

I appreciate the suggestion of adding hydroquinone-free brightening agents like vitamin C or niacinamide. I'll definitely incorporate those. Since underestimation of hydroquinone use is common, I'll revisit this with the patient. Perhaps phrasing the question differently might yield a more accurate history. Instead of asking how *long* she used hydroquinone products, I could ask about how *many* tubes or containers she used over the years. This might help her recall the actual quantity used, which could be more revealing than duration alone. While we've confirmed exogenous ochronosis, I'm still curious about the family history. She mentioned her mother having similar skin changes. Could this be a separate, coincidental case of melasma in the mother, or could there be other factors at play, perhaps environmental, that they were both exposed to? I know there's no genetic"

In addition to asking about the number of tubes or containers, I'll also ask about the concentration of the hydroquinone cream she used 10-15 years ago.

We have a patient presenting with painful, fixed, marble-sized lymphadenopathy, primarily cervical, with associated fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Symptoms began about three weeks after relocating from Brazil. The blood work shows peripheral eosinophilia, which I find particularly interesting given the travel history. While the initial presentation brought lymphoma to mind, the eosinophilia, combined with the travel history, shifts my thinking towards something parasitic or possibly fungal. My primary differential diagnoses at this point include: * **Parasitic infection:** Given the Brazil connection, something like Chagas disease (although lymphadenopathy isn't a prominent feature), toxoplasmosis, or even a filarial infection should be considered. The eosinophilia certainly supports this line of thinking. * **Fungal infection:** Histoplasmosis or paracoccidioidomycosis, endemic in certain areas of Brazil, could also present this way. *"

Knowing this would help prioritize which leishmaniasis serologies to order (e.g., specific species). 2.

Regarding the PPD, should we also consider QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing, given its higher specificity and lower chance of false positives due to prior BCG vaccination (which might be relevant given the patient's origin in Brazil)? 2. While lymphoma is still on the differential, the eosinophilia makes it less likely.

Given the potential for bone marrow involvement, and your recommendation for a bone marrow biopsy if other tests are negative, should we also consider a specific Leishmania PCR on the bone marrow aspirate if we proceed with that procedure?

Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few points and suggest some additional investigations based on the pulmonologist's recommendations. Regarding the BAL, could we also include testing for fungal cultures, including less common ones like *Aspergillus*, *Histoplasma*, and *Coccidioides*?

The extremely elevated LDH, the atypical lymphocytes aggregating within blood vessels on biopsy, and the positive immunohistochemical staining for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1 all point towards this diagnosis. The patient's constellation of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), along with the non-specific skin findings and evolving constitutional symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and altered bowel habits, also fit the profile. However, given the rarity of IVLBCL, I think it's prudent to consider other potential diagnoses before definitively concluding.

I'll arrange for a repeat biopsy from a different lesion, as you suggested, to confirm the findings. Given the patient's systemic symptoms and the aggressive nature of IVLBCL, I'm concerned about rapid disease progression. While we wait for the bone marrow biopsy and repeat skin biopsy, should we consider starting empiric treatment for IVLBCL? What are your thoughts on initiating R-CHOP chemotherapy?

Are there specific immunohistochemical stains we should request on the repeat skin biopsy and bone marrow that would help differentiate between the two?

I agree that flow cytometry on both peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate will be valuable, especially given the atypical lymphocytes observed in the skin biopsy. This could help us further characterize the neoplastic cells and potentially identify a specific immunophenotype. Given the potential for diverse organ involvement in IVLBCL, and considering the patient's altered bowel habits, should we consider imaging studies like a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to assess for gastrointestinal involvement?

The MRI might reveal subtle myocardial abnormalities we wouldn't see on the catheterization. Second, quantifying pericardial thickness and the presence of any ongoing inflammation could be helpful for prognostication and might influence the surgical approach if a pericardiectomy is ultimately considered.

The chest x-ray shows upper lobe-predominant peripheral and subpleural consolidations, consistent with pneumonia. While this explains some of the respiratory symptoms, a few things are giving me pause. Firstly, the patient has significant hypereosinophilia on their CBC. While eosinophilia can sometimes be seen in pneumonia, this level is quite pronounced. Coupled with the history of allergies and asthma, it raises the possibility of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) complicating the picture. The patient also reports night sweats and unintentional weight loss of approximately 20 pounds, which are concerning and not typical for a simple pneumonia.

While ABPA could contribute to some of this, it doesn't fully explain the severity of these constitutional symptoms. Would you recommend pursuing TB testing concurrently with the fungal studies? Given the patient's history of asthma and now pneumonia, their immune system might be compromised, increasing their susceptibility to opportunistic infections.

Should we consider a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the bronchoscopy to assess for eosinophils and other inflammatory markers in the lung fluid?

Initially, bladder cancer was high on my differential given the classic presentation of painless hematuria, especially considering the fatigue. However, the urinalysis showed pyuria with a negative urine culture, along with a significantly elevated eosinophil count. This points away from a straightforward malignancy and towards something like interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) or possibly a parasitic infection, although the patient denies any recent travel or known parasitic exposures. He also denies any increase in urinary frequency or urgency, which is somewhat atypical for IC/BPS. My primary concern remains ruling out bladder cancer. The cystoscopy and CT urogram results are crucial here. Do you have those available? Secondly, I'm curious about the eosinophilia. Could this be related to the skin findings?"

Checking ANA and ANCA is a good next step. A skin biopsy could also provide valuable information. Given the combination of hematuria, pyuria (despite a negative urine culture), eosinophilia, and the itchy, raised red bumps, I'm wondering if we should consider a systemic vasculitis affecting the kidneys and skin, such as IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) or even Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP), although HSP typically presents with joint pain, which this patient denies.

While IgA nephropathy and HSP are still on the differential, the absence of joint pain and other typical systemic symptoms makes them slightly less likely, though not impossible.

Laryngoscopy revealed white plaques on the vocal cords, and biopsy confirmed *Candida* laryngitis. While the *Candida* explains the hoarseness, I'm concerned about the overall clinical picture. The new dry cough, worsening shortness of breath, and history of heavy smoking raise the possibility of something more than just COPD exacerbation, even though he's already on inhaled steroids.

Regarding the TP-PA, if it comes back positive, confirming syphilis, would you recommend a lumbar puncture even in the absence of neurological symptoms, given his HIV status? Some guidelines suggest considering it in HIV-positive individuals with syphilis, regardless of symptoms. Also, while I agree that CMV and atypical mycobacteria are less likely, if the HSV therapy doesn't lead to improvement, I'd like to be prepared for the next steps. If we were to pursue special stains and cultures on a repeat biopsy, are there specific stains you'd recommend for CMV and mycobacteria in this context? For example, would an acid-fast stain be sufficient for mycobacteria, or should we also consider a specific stain like auramine-rhodamine? And for CMV, would immunohistochemical staining"

I will hold off on the lumbar puncture unless the TP-PA is positive *and* the patient develops neurological symptoms or has a high RPR titer. I've started the patient on valacyclovir empirically. We'll see how he responds over the next week or two. I've also requested a TP-PA and will ensure the lab collects a fresh lesion sample for repeat HSV, VZV PCR, and darkfield microscopy/DFA for syphilis. I've added chancroid culture to the testing as well. I'm still a bit puzzled by the chronicity and recurrence pattern, especially if the HSV PCR comes back negative again. If the valacyclovir doesn't lead to significant improvement, and the other tests are negative, I'll strongly consider a repeat biopsy with special stains and cultures for"

The doctor's line of questioning and ordered tests strongly suggest a concern for infections like herpes (HSV), syphilis, chancroid, and granuloma inguinale. The patient's HIV-positive status further complicates the picture, as it can increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections and influence the presentation of other STIs. While a dermatologist *could* also be involved due to the skin manifestations, the primary concern and differential diagnosis revolve around infectious etiologies. Therefore, an infectious disease specialist is best suited to manage this case, particularly given the diagnostic challenges and the patient's immunocompromised state."
