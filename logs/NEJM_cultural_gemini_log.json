She denies any other skin conditions, topical steroid use, and is not currently on any hormonal medications besides a multivitamin.

I didn't ask specifically about the composition of the hydroquinone cream, so I'll clarify whether it was a compounded triple combination cream (with tretinoin and a corticosteroid) or just hydroquinone. Prolonged use of a compounded cream, especially with a potent steroid, could indeed contribute to some of the observed symptoms. A photo would definitely be beneficial. I'll take one during the next visit when I perform the biopsy. Given the patient's reported sun sensitivity and the worsening of her symptoms with sun exposure, I'm leaning more towards melasma with a superimposed rosacea component.

To further clarify her sun exposure habits, I'll ask about the specific times of day she's outdoors, the duration of sun exposure during her walks, and whether she seeks shade during those times. I'll also ask if she uses sun protection on other body areas, which might give us a better understanding of her overall sun protection practices.

I'm thinking a combination of hydroquinone (assuming it's not the cause of the issue), tretinoin, and a mild corticosteroid, but I'm hesitant to restart hydroquinone given her previous lack of response and the potential for ochronosis. Perhaps a lower concentration or a different formulation might be considered?

My primary concern at this point is a less common parasitic infection, possibly one not endemic to North America, given the patient's recent arrival from Brazil. The negative stool examination doesn't entirely rule this out, as some parasites can be difficult to detect.

The HRCT will give us a more detailed look at the lung parenchyma and could reveal further characteristics suggestive of HP or sarcoidosis, such as the presence of micronodules or fibrosis. While HP and sarcoidosis are high on the differential, given the absence of systemic symptoms and the chronicity of the cough, we should also consider other less common interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Specifically, I'm thinking about: * **Respiratory Bronchiolitis-ILD (RB-ILD):** Although typically associated with smoking history, some cases can occur in nonsmokers. The crazy paving pattern can be seen in RB-ILD, and a surgical lung biopsy might be needed for definitive diagnosis if other tests are inconclusive."

It often presents with a more insidious onset and milder symptoms compared to acute HP, and the crazy paving pattern can be present. It's important to distinguish this from acute HP as the management differs. While RB-ILD is a possibility, the absence of a smoking history makes it less likely.

The significantly elevated LDH, along with the skin biopsy showing intravascular aggregates of atypical lymphocytes positive for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1, further solidifies this suspicion. However, before definitively concluding IVLBCL, I'd like to clarify a few points and suggest some additional investigations. 1. **Neurological Symptoms:** IVLBCL can frequently involve the central nervous system. Were any neurological symptoms documented, such as headaches, confusion, seizures, or focal neurological deficits? A brain MRI should be considered. 2. **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** Has a bone marrow biopsy been performed yet? This is crucial for staging and"

Regarding neurological symptoms, I did inquire about headaches, confusion, seizures, or focal deficits, and the patient denied experiencing any. However, given the insidious nature of IVLBCL and its propensity for CNS involvement, I agree that a brain MRI would be prudent alongside the PET/CT. You're right to emphasize the bone marrow biopsy. I haven't ordered one yet, as I wanted to discuss the case with you first. It's now definitely on the list of investigations to be performed.

Regarding recent infections, the patient denied any recent illnesses or known exposures.

Could you recommend any specific tests to consider in this context, perhaps focusing on less common or occult infections that might trigger such a response?

Before we proceed with these investigations, I have a couple of final clarifying questions: 1. Given the patient's skin lesions, and while the biopsy suggests IVLBCL, should we consider performing additional immunohistochemical stains on the skin biopsy itself for markers like CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD56, and CD30 to further differentiate between B-cell, T-cell, and NK-cell lineages within the skin lesions themselves?

While we await the bone marrow, PET/CT, and brain MRI results, should we consider starting a broad-spectrum antibiotic while the infectious disease workup is pending, or would that confound the results? I'm leaning towards holding off on antibiotics for now unless the patient develops signs of a specific infection, but I wanted your input. Also, given the potential for CNS involvement, should we consider prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy alongside systemic therapy once the diagnosis of IVLBCL is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy?

While the patient denies any history of radiation therapy, TB, or known inflammatory diseases, I'd like to explore a few possibilities with you.

Before we proceed with that, I have a couple of questions. Given the patient's history of slowly progressive dyspnea over three years, does this lean towards a specific etiology in your experience? For instance, is this timeframe more suggestive of a chronic inflammatory process versus an infectious or malignant cause? Secondly, regarding the pericardial biopsy, what's your preferred approach \u2013 surgical or percutaneous? And considering the calcification seen on the echo, do you anticipate any challenges with obtaining a sufficient sample?

The MRI might reveal features that make a percutaneous biopsy more feasible in a specific area, or conversely, confirm that a surgical approach is unavoidable. Furthermore, the MRI could provide more information about the degree of inflammation, which might influence our management strategy even before the biopsy results are available. For example, if the MRI shows significant ongoing inflammation, we might consider starting anti-inflammatory therapy while we await the biopsy results. What are your thoughts on that approach?

It's also present on her trunk and extremities, though less prominent, appearing more as flat, reddish-purple patches. The thickening is most noticeable on the hands, almost scleroderma-like, but again, the biopsy didn't support that. I can certainly get some photos for you to review. One thing that's been nagging at me is the progressive nature of the dysphagia alongside the skin changes. Could this potentially be some sort of par"

This, along with symptoms like clicking/popping, stiffness, and the visual observation of a \"dip\" above the kneecap, strongly suggests a problem with the musculoskeletal system, specifically the knees. Orthopedic surgeons specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. While the normal X-ray and MRI results might seem to complicate the picture, they don't rule out an orthopedic issue. Many soft tissue injuries or chronic conditions won't show up on these imaging tests. The orthopedic surgeon is best equipped to perform a physical exam, consider the mechanism of injury, and potentially recommend further diagnostic tests (like ultrasound or diagnostic arthroscopy) or treatments (like physical therapy, injections, or even surgery) to address the patient's ongoing knee problems."

To clarify, the X-rays were weight-bearing, which should give us a reasonable assessment of patellar position functionally. Given the chronicity and bilateral presentation, I'm still leaning towards a more functional issue rather than something like surgical adhesions causing patella baja.

Orthopedic surgeons specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. While the normal X-ray and MRI results might seem to complicate the picture, they don't rule out an orthopedic issue. Many soft tissue injuries or chronic conditions won't show up on these imaging tests. The orthopedic surgeon is best equipped to perform a physical exam, consider the mechanism of injury, and potentially recommend further diagnostic tests (like ultrasound or diagnostic arthroscopy) or treatments (like physical therapy, injections, or even surgery) to address the patient's ongoing knee problems."

Given her age and diabetic status, are there any antiviral treatments you would recommend, and what duration/dosage would be appropriate? I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on valacyclovir versus acyclovir in this context. 2. She reports a burning pain.

Would you consider a tricyclic antidepressant like amitriptyline as a first-line option for pain management, or perhaps as an adjunct if gabapentin/pregabalin aren't fully effective or tolerated? Also, are there any topical agents you recommend for localized pain relief and to help with the itching?

However, I'm still slightly concerned given the unusual presentation. If the thyroid tests and OCT come back normal, would you recommend proceeding directly to orbital imaging, or would you consider a neurological consult first, given the possibility of subtle optic neuropathy not readily apparent on OCT? Also, regarding the OCT, should we be looking specifically at the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, or are there other parameters we should pay close attention to in this case? Finally, while we wait for these test results, are there any other less common conditions we should be keeping in mind, perhaps related to neuromuscular transmission or mitochondrial dysfunction, that might explain this constellation of symptoms?"

The patient denies any recent changes in hygiene products, travel, known allergen exposure, or systemic allergic symptoms. He also denies any history of UTIs, kidney stones, or trauma. My initial concern, given the classic presentation, was urothelial carcinoma, particularly bladder cancer. However, the absence of other urinary symptoms and the marked eosinophilia point towards a different etiology. The negative urine culture argues against a typical bacterial UTI, although it doesn't entirely rule out an atypical infection.

I've obtained high-resolution photos of the lesions and will forward them to you shortly. They show well-demarcated ulcers with a slightly rolled border and a clean base, no obvious discharge or surrounding satellite lesions. They don't appear particularly suggestive of a fungal infection clinically, but I agree the PAS stain would be helpful to definitively rule it out. I also spoke with the patient again and clarified his antiretroviral regimen. He's currently on Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine. His CD4 count has been stable around 500 for the past six months, but his viral load remains detectable, suggesting suboptimal control. This reinforces the need to consider opportunistic infections and HIV-related malignancies. Given the stable, albeit moderately low, CD4 count"

You're right, the rolled border does make herpes less likely, though I wouldn't rule it out completely given the other features and his HIV status. I did order syphilis testing (RPR and confirmatory testing if needed) as part of the initial workup. I agree about the infectious disease consult; I'll put that in as well. I've sent the high-resolution photos \u2013 let me know what you think. Given the rolled border and the patient's immunosuppression, I'm now also considering cutaneous manifestations of syphilis, even though the chronicity and recurrence pattern aren't typical. Could this be a chancre redux, or perhaps an unusual presentation of secondary syphilis? I know the monthly recurrence is throwing things off, but I'm wondering if the partial immune response due to the HIV and antiretrovirals is causing this atypical cyclical pattern. I also wanted to get your"

While the symptoms initially point towards an STI and thus a visit to a Urologist or Sexual Health specialist might seem appropriate, the patient's HIV-positive status adds complexity. The doctor has already ordered tests for common STIs. A Dermatologist specializes in skin conditions and is best equipped to diagnose and manage skin manifestations related to HIV, which can sometimes mimic other conditions. The biopsy results, including epidermal necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate, further support the need for a dermatologist's expertise. They can differentiate between STIs, HIV-related skin issues, or other dermatological problems potentially exacerbated by the compromised immune system."
