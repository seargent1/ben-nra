The patient presents with a one-month history of progressively worsening double vision, proximal upper limb weakness, and difficulty climbing stairs. All symptoms began around the same time and worsen in the evenings, particularly with upward gaze. The weakness affects both arms, predominantly the proximal muscles. The patient denies any bulbar symptoms like dysphagia, dysarthria, or ptosis. No other autonomic symptoms, skin changes, or recent illnesses were reported. Family history is negative for neurological conditions. The acetylcholine receptor antibody test returned positive. The patient also confirms that the weakness fluctuates, worsening with activity and improving with rest. No respiratory or cardiac symptoms were reported. My primary diagnosis is Myasthenia Gravis (MG), given the positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the classic symptoms of fluctuating muscle weakness, particularly affecting the extraocular and proximal limb muscles. The worsening of symptoms in the evenings is also consistent with MG."

Before we solidify the MG diagnosis, are there any other conditions in the differential we should consider, even if less likely? I'm thinking specifically about Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), given the proximal muscle weakness. While the patient doesn't report autonomic symptoms, which are common in LEMS, they might be subtle. Could we consider adding voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing to the workup?

While the absence of autonomic symptoms makes LEMS less likely, the proximal predominance of weakness warrants ruling it out definitively. The PFTs will provide a baseline for monitoring respiratory function, especially given the potential for future bulbar involvement. I'm also thinking about the patient's double vision. While diplopia is a common presenting symptom in MG, I want to ensure we've thoroughly explored all possibilities. Given the gradual onset and worsening in the evenings, could there be another ophthalmological cause contributing to the diplopia, such as thyroid eye disease? Although the patient denies other symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, I think a thyroid function test is warranted to be comprehensive. Finally, while the positive AChR antibodies strongly point towards MG, are there any other rarer neuromuscular junction disorders we should keep in mind, such as MuSK"

I'll add those tests to the order. Given the patient's age and the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, I'm wondering if we should also consider inflammatory myopathies, even though the fluctuating nature of the weakness points more towards a neuromuscular junction disorder. Could we consider adding a creatine kinase (CK) level to the workup? While I wouldn't expect it to be dramatically elevated in MG, it could help differentiate if there's a myopathic component. Also, regarding the ophthalmological assessment, would you recommend a formal ophthalmology consult at this stage, or should we wait for the results of the additional tests we've discussed?

Vitals are stable except for some mild tachypnea. Exam reveals a distended, but soft abdomen, tympanitic in the left lower quadrant, with increased crying on palpation there. Normal bowel sounds are present. Initial labs showed a normal CBC and CMP. An abdominal X-ray revealed dilated bowel loops and an absence of rectal gas, raising concern for obstruction. Given the clinical picture, intussusception was high on the differential, but a barium enema surprisingly revealed a transition zone in the distal colon, highly suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease.

The CD20 positivity on the biopsy confirms the B-cell origin. However, the lack of significant findings on the CT scan of the thorax and abdomen, aside from the enlarged lymph nodes, is somewhat puzzling, especially given the patient's abdominal discomfort and early satiety. The normal CMP, ESR, and CRP are also a bit unexpected, though not entirely inconsistent with lymphoma.

Assuming the ultrasound doesn't reveal a clear cause of the abdominal symptoms, and the mesentery appears normal, I'd like to proceed with upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, as you suggested. I'm particularly concerned about the possibility of a low-grade lymphoma affecting the GI tract, which might not be readily apparent on imaging. The early satiety and abdominal fullness, despite weight loss, are still nagging at me. While we're waiting for those procedures, I'd like to revisit the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy. Even if the GI tract looks normal on endoscopy and colonoscopy, the bone marrow biopsy could still provide valuable information for staging and help explain the constitutional symptoms, especially if"

Should we consider a repeat blood culture or any other tests to rule out an occult infection contributing to the clinical picture? Second, while DLBCL seems most likely, the somewhat atypical presentation with the prominent abdominal symptoms and lack of significant findings on the initial CT scan makes me wonder about other less common lymphoma subtypes, such as mantle cell lymphoma or even a marginal zone lymphoma, particularly given the GI symptoms.

The lack of a reported \"pop\" at the time of injury doesn't rule it out, as these can sometimes be insidious. The X-ray and MRI ruled out fractures and significant effusion, which is helpful. My differential diagnosis includes: 1. **Medial Meniscus Tear:** This is my primary suspicion given the mechanism and symptoms. 2. **MCL Sprain:** While the patient reports instability, it's described as \"wobbly\" rather than a distinct feeling of the knee giving way.

To help differentiate further, I'll pay close attention to the precise location of tenderness during palpation. Specifically, I'll palpate the pes anserine bursa, the patellar tendon, and the medial joint line to assess for point tenderness. I'll also assess patellar tracking and evaluate for any hamstring weakness.

She also reports chills and tenderness in the perineal area. While we're waiting on cultures of the vaginal discharge, CBC, urinalysis, and a pelvic ultrasound, my primary concern is postpartum endometritis. Given the prolonged labor, large infant, and vaginal delivery, there's an increased risk of infection. The brownish lochia and unpleasant odor further support this suspicion. However, we need to consider other possibilities in the differential diagnosis. My questions for you are: 1.

Assuming the patient responds well to the broad-spectrum antibiotics, how long should we continue treatment? Are there specific parameters we should monitor to assess response to therapy, such as temperature trends, white blood cell count, and resolution of abdominal tenderness? Also, considering the patient is breastfeeding, are there any specific considerations regarding the use of clindamycin, gentamicin, and ampicillin in this context?

The digital rectal exam confirmed this, and anoscopy visualized the hemorrhoids. She denies any pain, change in bowel habits, mucus, or pus in her stool. Her CBC is normal, and she denies any recent changes in diet, medications, or supplements. No personal or family history of hemorrhoids, anal fissures, colon cancer, or IBD is reported.

I'll follow up with the family about any recent illnesses, including seemingly minor infections. Regarding the grandmother's episodes, I asked for more details, but the information provided was limited. The patient described her grandmother as \"spacing out,\" but couldn't elaborate on the nature of these episodes. I'll try to obtain more information from the family, perhaps by speaking directly with the grandmother or another family member who can provide a more detailed account.

While the patient appears otherwise healthy, subclinical hypothyroidism can sometimes manifest with neurological symptoms, and an MRI can help exclude any structural lesions, such as a tumor or focal cortical dysplasia, that could be causing the seizures. A detailed developmental history is also a good point. Were there any delays in reaching developmental milestones, any learning difficulties, or any behavioral issues that might suggest an underlying neurological predisposition? I'm particularly interested in the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis, given the relatively recent onset of seizures and the lack of a clear precipitating factor. While the patient denied any recent infections, sometimes these can be subtle and overlooked. Would you recommend any specific antibody panels to consider, such as anti-NMDA receptor antibodies or VGKC-complex antibodies?

Given the EEG findings localized to the temporal lobe, should we consider a targeted temporal lobe protocol for the MRI, or would you recommend a full brain scan?

Given that a dashboard injury is a valid consideration, and recognizing that the post-reduction CT will primarily assess for bony injury, should we consider adding a dedicated sciatic nerve study (e.g., EMG/NCS) either now or in the near future, especially if the patient reports any paresthesias or neurological deficits on examination? While you will be assessing vascular status clinically, would you be open to a pre-reduction ankle-brachial index (ABI) just to provide baseline data, especially given the potential for vascular compromise in a high-impact dashboard injury? It could be helpful to have that information readily available for comparison post-reduction"

Sometimes standard pelvic CT protocols can miss subtle acetabular fractures. 2. While I understand the preference for post-reduction EMG/NCS for the sciatic nerve, if the patient reports significant or worsening paresthesias prior to the reduction, would you be open to reconsidering a pre-reduction study?

Based on the patient's history and the negative x-ray, I'm suspecting a mallet finger, specifically a soft tissue mallet finger involving a probable extensor tendon injury at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. The mechanism of injury (finger bent back forcefully), the inability to extend the DIP joint, localized pain and swelling at the DIP, and the absence of fracture on x-ray all point towards this diagnosis. However, I'd like to discuss a few other possibilities and get your opinion. While less likely given the mechanism and presentation, could we be looking at a volar plate injury? The patient reports pain on the sides of the joint with palpation, which could suggest this.

My main remaining question is regarding the patient's reported pain on lateral palpation of the joint. While less common in mallet finger, it does raise a slight concern about potential involvement of the collateral ligaments. Could the ultrasound also assess the integrity of the collateral ligaments?

Given the patient's young age and involvement in sports, I'm particularly interested in ensuring optimal long-term function. While 6 weeks of splinting is standard, would you consider a slightly longer period, perhaps 8 weeks, if the ultrasound reveals significant tendon retraction or a larger avulsion fracture?

We have a painful, progressively enlarging ulcerative lesion with surrounding swelling, dependent pain relieved by elevation, and throbbing, particularly at night.

A normal venous duplex doesn't completely rule out venous disease, especially if the study was limited to the deep system and didn't adequately assess superficial venous reflux. Could we discuss the specifics of the ultrasound report? Did it include evaluation of the superficial venous system, and were there any borderline findings?

I agree that ABI and toe pressures are crucial to further evaluate for arterial involvement, even though the presentation is less suggestive of arterial insufficiency. I'll order those tests as well. Beyond these crucial next steps, I'd like to discuss a few other considerations. Given the patient's history of Crohn's disease, could pyoderma gangrenosum be a possibility?

Also, I'm curious about your thoughts on the potential for a mixed arterial-venous etiology. While the presentation leans more towards venous insufficiency, the patient does have risk factors for arterial disease (diabetes, hypertension). Could the combination of compromised arterial inflow and venous outflow be contributing to the ulceration, even if neither is severe enough to be readily detected on initial testing?

This 38-week pregnant patient presents with sudden onset of heavy vaginal bleeding, a sharp, tearing abdominal pain, and decreased fetal movement following some initial contractions. The pain is constant and severe, and she's now feeling lightheaded. Given her history of a previous C-section, uterine rupture is my primary concern. The heavy bleeding, severe pain, and cessation of fetal movement all point towards this possibility. While the absence of scar tenderness might argue against a rupture, it's not a reliable excluding factor. I'm also concerned about placental abruption, given the heavy bleeding and pain. However, the tearing nature of the pain makes uterine rupture more likely in my mind. My differential diagnosis includes: 1. **Uterine Rupture:** This is the most concerning possibility given the history of C-section, the nature of the pain, the heavy bleeding, and decreased fetal movement."

While uterine rupture seems most likely, the initial contractions she experienced make me wonder about the possibility of a placental abruption contributing to, or even triggering, the rupture. Could the abruption have stressed the uterine scar, leading to the rupture? Should we be anticipating potential coagulopathy related to a possible abruption as well? Also, while less likely given the severity of the presentation, could we be missing something like vasa previa or a low-lying placenta with associated hemorrhage?

For example, are there any specific medications we should consider administering en route, or any particular precautions we should take during the transport? Also, while I understand vasa previa and low-lying placenta are less likely, given the initial contractions the patient reported, is there any value in a quick bedside ultrasound scan before transport, if time and resources allow, to definitively rule those out or at least gain more information?

If intraoperatively we find no evidence of a rupture, but the placenta shows signs of abruption, should we anticipate a different pattern of coagulopathy compared to what we'd expect with a rupture alone?

One last question to ensure we're fully prepared: While less likely given the acute and severe presentation, could the initial contractions the patient described have been related to preterm labor, which then somehow contributed to either the suspected rupture or a potential abruption? Should we be considering any tocolytics at all, either now en route or potentially intraoperatively if we encounter unexpected uterine activity, or are the risks of using tocolytics in this scenario, given the potential for hemorrhage, too high to justify their use? I'm mainly thinking about potential benefits for the fetus if we can stabilize the uterus, but I defer to your expertise on whether that's even a reasonable consideration in this context."

While the initial CMV PCR and fundus photography were normal, I'm still highly suspicious given the clinical picture. My primary differential diagnosis remains CMV retinitis, even with the negative initial tests. False negatives can occur, especially early in the infection. Other opportunistic infections we need to consider include toxoplasmosis, progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN), and fungal retinitis (though less common). Syphilis is also a possibility, though less likely given the absence of other symptoms.

Also, while the patient denies flashes of light and distorted vision (metamorphopsia), which are classic for CMV retinitis, could these symptoms be absent in early stages or with a less aggressive presentation? Finally, what are your thoughts on initiating empiric treatment for CMV retinitis while we await the repeat PCR results, considering the potential for rapid vision loss with this infection and his already critically low CD4 count?

Given the patient's sexual history and the dysuria preceding the joint pain, I'm leaning towards a sexually transmitted infection as the underlying cause. The conjunctivitis further strengthens this suspicion. While reactive arthritis classically presents with the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, disseminated gonococcal infection can mimic this presentation.

The margin of excision will depend on the final pathology report, but we'll likely aim for a 1-2 cm margin. Given the ulceration and Breslow depth of 2.5mm, adjuvant therapy is definitely a consideration. Specifically, high-dose interferon (IFN) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 therapy) are options. However, I'm leaning towards discussing the possibility of adjuvant pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 therapy) with the patient, given its generally more favorable toxicity profile compared to IFN and ipilimumab.

The persistence of symptoms, particularly the frequent incomplete evacuation reported by the patient, now leads me to suspect post-infectious IBS. I'm curious about a few things. First, given the negative ova and parasites, did the initial stool sample include a culture and sensitivity test to identify any bacterial pathogens that might have been missed? Secondly, has the patient experienced any other symptoms suggestive of IBS, such as alternating constipation and diarrhea, or a change in stool frequency since the onset of illness?

We have a young woman presenting with shortness of breath, increased abdominal girth, and now we've discovered a large ovarian mass with significant ascites and a right-sided pleural effusion. The concerning part is the rapid onset of symptoms, just within the last month. While she denies any weight loss, she reports early satiety. The CA-125 came back normal, which is somewhat unexpected. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, given the presentation. The ascites and pleural effusion suggest possible metastatic spread. However, the normal CA-125 makes me wonder about other possibilities. What are your initial thoughts on the differential diagnosis? Do you think a benign ovarian process could cause this rapid accumulation of ascites and pleural effusion? Also, what's your preferred approach to obtaining a tissue diagnosis \u2013 fine needle aspiration, core biopsy, or laparoscopic biopsy? I'm leaning towards the"

A few more questions: What other benign ovarian processes could mimic this presentation? Could a borderline ovarian tumor cause this degree of ascites and pleural effusion? Also, given the normal CA-125, are there any specific immunohistochemical stains or molecular tests we should consider on the biopsy specimen that might help differentiate between a benign, borderline, and malignant process? Finally, what's your opinion on performing a paracentesis to relieve the patient's shortness of breath and potentially obtain fluid for cytology?

Could a germ cell tumor, perhaps a dysgerminoma or immature teratoma, present with this degree of ascites and pleural effusion? Are there any specific tumor markers we should consider for germ cell tumors, such as AFP, beta-hCG, or LDH?

Given the patient's young age and the rapid accumulation of ascites and pleural effusion, even with a normal CA-125, should we consider the possibility of a juvenile granulosa cell tumor, even though it's rare? Are there any specific features we should look for on the biopsy that might suggest this diagnosis? 2.
