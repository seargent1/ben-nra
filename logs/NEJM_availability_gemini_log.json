The fact that she's African American, a population more prone to this condition, further strengthens my suspicion. The biopsy will hopefully confirm this. My main differential diagnoses, besides exogenous ochronosis, would include: * **Melasma:** While she initially used the cream for melasma, the worsening and change in pigmentation despite treatment makes this less likely. The bluish-brown hue isn't typical for melasma. * **Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH):** Possible, but the chronicity and lack of a clear inflammatory trigger make it less probable. * **Drug-induced pigmentation:** Given the use of the hydroquinone cream, this is high on"

Given her ethnicity and the potential for ochronosis, I'm curious about her mother's history of hyperpigmentation. Do you think it's possible her mother also experienced exogenous ochronosis, perhaps from using similar products? It might be worth exploring that further with the patient. While I believe exogenous ochronosis is the most probable diagnosis, I want to be thorough. Are there any other conditions, perhaps rarer ones, that we should consider in the differential, given her presentation?

The distribution, the lack of itching in this case (which is often prominent in lichenoid dermatitis), and the absence of other associated symptoms make them less probable. Given the patient's gardening hobby and sun exposure, even with inconsistent sunscreen use, could the hydroquinone-induced ochronosis be exacerbated by the sun? Is there a synergistic effect we should be aware of? Should we consider a component of phototoxic drug reaction or even actinic lichen planus in the differential, given the sun exposure and the potential for a lichenoid reaction?

Before we proceed with the more invasive procedures, I'd like to gather a bit more information. Could we get the patient's age and a detailed social history, including hobbies, any recent renovations at home or work, and specifically ask about exposure to printers/copiers and the types of cleaning products used in their office environment? Even seemingly innocuous hobbies can sometimes provide clues. For example, do they garden, use a humidifier, or participate in any activities that might involve exposure to mold or other"

Given the potential for vasculitis, and considering the ulcerating skin lesions, particularly on the legs, should we also consider a skin biopsy? This could provide valuable histopathological information and potentially help differentiate between vasculitis, an infectious process, or a neoplastic process. Regarding hematologic malignancies, are there any specific subtypes you'd be more suspicious of given the presentation?

This could help identify any monoclonal gammopathies that might be associated with certain lymphomas or other hematologic conditions. Also, while the patient denies any specific travel history to endemic areas, I'd like to clarify their living situation and any potential environmental exposures.

Would you recommend testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies at this stage, or should we wait for the results of the other tests?

We should also assess for the characteristic square root sign or dip and plateau waveform during right heart catheterization. A chest CT is also a good suggestion.

A PET scan to assess for systemic involvement also makes sense, especially given the potential for esophageal involvement and the persistent nature of the symptoms. I'm still a bit hesitant to fully commit to MRH given the absence of arthritis. While I understand it can be absent, it's a pretty prominent feature in most cases, isn't it? Are there any other features we should be looking for, perhaps in the biopsy, that would strengthen the case for MRH? For example, are there specific types of granulomas or other histologic findings that are more characteristic of MRH than other granulomatous dermatoses? Also, I'm curious about the patient's prognosis if it *is* MRH. I understand the disease course can be quite variable. Are there any prognostic factors we should"

Given the duration of the infestation (four months), I'm wondering if we should consider a secondary bacterial infection. While the patient didn't report any overt signs of infection like increased pain, purulent drainage, or fever, the prolonged itching and scratching could have introduced bacteria. Should I recommend a follow-up appointment to assess for this possibility, or would you suggest a prophylactic course of antibiotics at this stage?

Could the seemingly less severe presentation be due to a partially effective immune response, or perhaps misdiagnosis of the initial lesions? Should I consider a repeat skin scraping at the follow-up appointment to ensure complete eradication, especially given the potential for higher mite counts in Norwegian scabies?

Just to be thorough, since the infestation was present for an extended period, are there any other conditions that can sometimes mimic scabies, particularly in cases where the presentation might be slightly atypical, that we should consider in the differential, even if less likely? I'm thinking along the lines of atopic dermatitis with secondary excoriation, or perhaps even a rare form of contact dermatitis.

Could the scabies infestation have exacerbated a pre-existing, subclinical condition like atopic dermatitis, contributing to the prolonged duration and the tingling sensation? Or could the tingling be a sign of a secondary nerve involvement, perhaps due to persistent scratching and inflammation? While unlikely, I'd like to rule out any potential peripheral neuropathy related to the prolonged infestation. Finally, are there any specific recommendations for follow-up beyond the 1-2 weeks, especially regarding the potential for post-scabetic pruritus?

Given the potential for subtle corneal irregularities, I'm wondering if we should also consider performing corneal pachymetry? This could help us identify any areas of abnormal corneal thickness, which might contribute to the blurry vision and be related to the transplants. Also, while the patient hasn't reported halos, given the history of corneal transplants, could we be dealing with some degree of endothelial cell loss or dysfunction, even if it's not severe enough to cause significant corneal edema? Would it be worthwhile to assess endothelial cell density as well?

I'll add those to the testing list. Regarding the lower lid position, I agree that formal measurements of marginal reflex distance (MRD1 and MRD2) and palpebral fissure height are necessary. Even though previous examinations haven't revealed overt ptosis, these measurements will provide more precise data and could reveal subtle changes that might be contributing to the patient's sensation of the lids obstructing their vision, especially when looking down.

While drug-induced interstitial nephritis is a strong possibility, the persistent *gross* hematuria, especially without any reported pain, still makes me hesitant to completely shift away from considering a malignancy. Interstitial nephritis can cause hematuria, but it's typically microscopic, not the visible blood this patient is describing. Therefore, I have a few more questions: 1.

Some parasitic infections, like schistosomiasis, can cause urinary symptoms including hematuria, and are associated with eosinophilia.

However, the biopsy pointed towards a fungal infection, yet the culture came back negative. Now we're back to square one, with the hoarseness still unresolved. My primary concern is ruling out more serious pathologies. While the patient denies any pain, dysphagia, or odynophagia, the persistent nature of the hoarseness warrants further investigation.

Given the specialist's recommendation, I'll also add testing for chancroid ( *Haemophilus ducreyi* ) and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). To further differentiate, could you elaborate on what features in this case make chancroid and LGV considerations, particularly given the year-long duration? The classic presentation of chancroid is often described as more acutely painful with a \"soft\" ulcer, and LGV often involves a more pronounced initial lesion followed by lymphadenopathy. Is the chronicity and recurrence here enough to warrant these additions to the differential, even with the seemingly classic HSV presentation? Also, while we await the STI results, I'm going to order a CD4 count and viral load to assess his current HIV status and determine if his fatigue"

Given the patient's description of the sores starting as small bumps before ulcerating, and the mention of inguinal lymphadenopathy, I'm wondering if a biopsy might be helpful sooner rather than later, even before the initial STI results return. Could this offer any advantage in terms of identifying the causative agent more rapidly, or perhaps revealing any unusual histopathological features related to his HIV status? Also, are there any specific staining techniques or molecular tests you'd recommend on the biopsy specimen, considering the differential? Finally, while less likely given the clinical picture, should we also consider other ulcerative genital conditions like granuloma inguinale (Donovanosis) in the differential, or would you consider that a lower priority at this stage given the absence of described beefy-red, friable lesions"

I agree that Donovanosis is less likely but will keep it in mind if these initial tests are negative. Given the patient's self-reported lapse in HIV care, I'm concerned about potential immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) if his CD4 count is significantly low and we start him on effective treatment for the ulcerative lesions. Should we consider starting him empirically on antiretroviral therapy now, or should we wait for the CD4/viral load results? What's the best approach to balance the risk of IRIS with the need to improve his immune function? Also, regarding the biopsy, are there any specific recommendations for the biopsy site or technique (e.g., punch biopsy, shave biopsy) to optimize diagnostic yield? And in terms of histopathology, are there"

Regarding the acyclovir, what dosage and duration would you recommend empirically? Should we consider suppressive therapy versus episodic treatment at this point, given the recurrent nature of his lesions? Also, while HSV is high on the differential, the patient's lack of adherence to HIV care raises the possibility of other STIs or even something more unusual. If the PCR from the biopsy comes back negative for HSV, *H. ducreyi*, and LGV, what would be your next diagnostic steps?

The patient presents with recurring genital sores, which are a hallmark symptom of several sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The doctor's questions and requested tests (HSV and syphilis) clearly point towards concern about an infectious process. The patient's HIV-positive status further complicates the picture, making it crucial to consult a specialist who can manage both the potential STI and its interaction with the patient's compromised immune system. An infectious disease specialist has the expertise to diagnose and treat complex infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. While a dermatologist *could* diagnose some STIs, the patient's HIV status necessitates the broader perspective of an ID specialist."
