I'm strongly leaning towards a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) based on the constellation of symptoms and the positive acetylcholine receptor antibody test, along with the characteristic EMG findings and the ptosis observed during the neurological exam. The fluctuating weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles, worsening with activity and improving with rest, along with the binocular diplopia, are all highly suggestive. However, I do have a few questions and thoughts I'd like to discuss. First, while the patient denies bulbar symptoms like difficulty chewing or swallowing, she did mention feeling like she can't quite get a full breath after exertion. This could be an early sign of respiratory muscle involvement, which is a serious concern in MG. I'd like your opinion on whether we should consider pulmonary function tests (PFTs) now, or if we should monitor her respiratory status closely and perform PFTs only if she develops more overt respiratory symptoms"

While her symptoms point strongly towards generalized MG, I was also considering the possibility of ocular myasthenia, given the prominence of diplopia and ptosis. However, the limb weakness and the EMG findings make generalized MG more likely. Do you think there's any value in further investigations to differentiate between ocular and generalized MG at this stage, or should we proceed with management as generalized MG given the current evidence? Also, considering the patient's age and the potential for thymoma, would you recommend imaging of the thymus, such as a CT scan or MRI? And finally, what are your thoughts on initiating treatment?

A couple of follow-up questions regarding treatment: 1. Given the patient's relatively mild symptoms at this point, would you recommend starting with a low dose of pyridostigmine and titrating up based on her response, or would a standard starting dose be appropriate? I'm trying to balance efficacy with minimizing potential side effects. 2. Regarding immunosuppressants, if we do need to add one, would you prefer prednisone or consider starting with a steroid-sparing agent like azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil given the potential long-term side effects of corticosteroids?

To answer your question about the EMG, while it did show a decremental response, it wasn't as pronounced as I might have expected given the degree of clinical weakness. This isn't necessarily unusual in MG, but it did make me briefly consider other neuromuscular junction disorders, like Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), although the overall clinical picture and the positive AChR antibodies strongly favor MG. I suppose my question is, given the slightly less robust EMG findings, is there any other electrodiagnostic test, like single-fiber EMG, that you would recommend to solidify the diagnosis or rule out other less likely possibilities? Also, regarding the patient's report of feeling like she can't get a full breath, even though her PFTs haven't been done yet, should we consider any prophylactic measures in the meantime, such as patient education on recognizing signs of respiratory distress or having her obtain a"

That's definitely high on my list of questions given the Crohn's history. Beyond Natalizumab, I'm also concerned about other immunosuppressants. Crohn's disease is often managed with a combination of medications, and many can contribute to immunosuppression. We need a comprehensive list including corticosteroids, thiopurines (like azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate, and other biologics besides Natalizumab. Even if they aren't currently on Natalizumab, past exposure still increases the risk of PML, so I'll ask about that as well."

Given the patient's age (I should have mentioned this earlier, they are 45), I'm less suspicious of a primary immunodeficiency, but it's worth investigating.

The abdominal X-ray shows dilated bowel loops and an absence of gas in the rectum, concerning for an obstruction. My primary concern is intussusception given the age and presentation. My questions for you are: 1. Do you concur with the suspicion of intussusception? 2. What other diagnoses should we be considering given the lack of vomiting and current information? Could this be Hirschsprung's"

While the initial biopsy showed CD20 positivity and a high proliferative index, could we discuss which additional immunophenotyping markers would be most helpful in differentiating between DLBCL and other subtypes? Specifically, I'm thinking of including cyclin D1 for mantle cell lymphoma, CD5 and CD10 for marginal zone lymphoma, and CD23 and FMC7 to further refine the B-cell lineage and help distinguish between different subtypes. Would you agree with these additions?"

The patient developed fatigue, right flank pain, and fever after starting amoxicillin for sinusitis. Crucially, they developed a maculopapular rash prompting a switch to cephalexin. The rash resolved quickly after discontinuing amoxicillin. Urinalysis showed leukocyturia and interestingly, 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, which while not pathognomonic, can be suggestive of DIN. Critically, serum creatinine and BUN are both elevated, confirming acute kidney injury. The patient also reports decreased urine output. My primary concern is DIN secondary to the amoxicillin. While cephalexin is also a beta-lactam, the rapid resolution of the rash after stopping amoxicillin and the temporal relationship of symptom onset points towards amoxicillin as the culprit."

Should we consider a kidney biopsy in this case? While the clinical picture strongly suggests DIN, a biopsy could definitively confirm the diagnosis and rule out other rarer causes of acute interstitial nephritis, especially if the patient doesn't respond to steroids as expected. 2. Regarding the prednisone, 1mg/kg/day seems like a reasonable starting dose. However, are there any specific contraindications to steroid use we should be aware of in this patient, such as uncontrolled diabetes or active infections (besides the resolved sinusitis)?

While the x-ray didn't show an effusion, a subtle one could still be present and might suggest more inflammatory processes like bursitis or plica syndrome. 2.

While not always present with a meniscus tear, it's somewhat surprising given the reported pain level and the acuteness of the injury. Could this potentially suggest a more peripheral tear, as opposed to a tear in the more vascularized zone? Peripheral tears tend to produce less swelling. Also, considering her age and activity level (competitive volleyball), I'm leaning towards early surgical intervention if the MRI confirms a significant tear, especially if it's displaced or involves the weight-bearing portion of the meniscus. What are your thoughts on early surgical intervention versus conservative management in a young, active patient with a confirmed meniscus tear? Finally, should we consider any additional imaging or tests at this point, or are we comfortable waiting for the MRI?"

Even though the initial ECG and other tests were normal, underlying heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) or other cardiovascular issues can be intermittent and might not be detected during a single examination. A cardiologist can perform more comprehensive tests, such as a Holter monitor or echocardiogram, to rule out potentially dangerous cardiac conditions.

The fact that it occurred during nighttime urination raises the possibility of micturition syncope, but given his age, we need to be thorough. I'd like your opinion on further investigations. Would you recommend a 24-hour Holter monitor to assess for any intermittent arrhythmias? Also, given his age and the potential for underlying structural heart disease, would a cardiac ultrasound (echocardiogram"

My primary concern is ruling out potentially serious cardiac issues, particularly given his age. Before we proceed with those, I have a couple of clarifying questions regarding the patient's history. Did the patient mention any prodromal symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea *before* the urge to urinate, or was it strictly post-micturition? This might help distinguish between orthostatic/micturition syncope and other causes. Also, while the patient denies any known heart conditions, is there any family history of sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy, or significant arrhythmias? This information could influence our risk stratification. Finally, while his blood pressure was recorded as 130/85 in the clinic, do we have a baseline blood pressure"

Even though the initial ECG and other tests were normal, underlying heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) or other cardiovascular issues can be intermittent and might not be detected during a single examination. A cardiologist can perform more comprehensive tests, such as a Holter monitor or echocardiogram, to rule out potentially dangerous cardiac conditions.

Even if the MRI suggests a benign process, I think the rapid growth and the somewhat unusual imaging presentation warrant a more aggressive approach. My questions are: 1. **Regarding surgical options:** While we await the MRI, could we discuss the specifics of surgical margins you'd recommend for each scenario (benign, borderline, and malignant)?

Are there particular characteristics, such as internal heterogeneity, enhancement patterns, or the presence of necrosis, that would sway your decision-making regarding margin width or even the need for a mastectomy? 2. **Sentinel lymph node biopsy:** While I understand that phyllodes tumors rarely spread to lymph nodes, the rapid growth in this case raises a slight concern.

The frequent urination without dysuria could be due to uterine subinvolution or bladder irritation from the infection. However, given the large baby and prolonged labor, I'm also considering other possibilities. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is possible, though less likely given the lack of dysuria.

Beyond trauma, are there any other differential diagnoses we should consider at this stage, even if less likely given the current presentation?

She describes her right leg as appearing shorter, internally rotated, and slightly flexed at the knee. She has limited and painful range of motion of the right hip, with any attempt to straighten or externally rotate the leg exacerbating the groin pain. Pelvic X-rays confirm the suspected posterior dislocation with no associated fractures of the pelvic ring or femoral neck.

I'm thinking specifically about things like a posterior wall acetabular fracture with associated hip instability, even if subtle, or an associated sciatic nerve injury, although she doesn't report any neurological deficits at this time.

Given the mechanism of injury (the finger being yanked), while less likely than a mallet finger, could there still be a possibility of a concomitant proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint injury, such as a subtle ligament sprain or avulsion? Should I also be palpating and assessing the stability of the PIP joint during the re-examination, even though the patient's primary complaint is localized to the DIP?

Before we initiate compression therapy, I'd like to rule out arterial insufficiency contributing to the ulcer, especially given the necrotic appearance of the wound bed. A low ABI would suggest that compression therapy could be harmful. While less likely given the clinical picture, could we also consider other differentials such as pyoderma gangrenosum or even a malignant ulcer, particularly given the irregular border and lack of significant exudate? Should we consider a biopsy of the ulcer edge if the ultrasound findings don't definitively point towards venous insufficiency? Finally, the patient mentioned taking mesalamine.

Could this indicate a superimposed infection, even without overt purulence, or perhaps some degree of arterial compromise despite what we might find on the ABI? Would you recommend a toe-brachial index (TBI) in addition to the ABI, as it might be more sensitive in detecting distal arterial disease, especially in patients with diabetes who can have calcified arteries leading to falsely elevated ABI readings?

This could help us further assess the microcirculation and tissue oxygenation at the wound site, which might be compromised even if the ABI and TBI are within acceptable ranges. A low TcPO2 could indicate impaired healing potential and guide us towards more aggressive interventions, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, if necessary. Furthermore, while we're considering additional testing, would a skin biopsy, specifically for histopathology, be beneficial at this stage?

The acute onset of sharp, stabbing pain radiating down the lateral aspect of the leg to the foot, along with numbness, tingling, and weakness, strongly suggests nerve root compression. The positive response to movement, particularly bending and twisting, further supports this diagnosis. The mechanism of injury, squats with moderate weight at the gym, is also typical. While the MRI confirms the herniation, I'd like to discuss a few points to refine our understanding and management plan. First, the patient mentions increasing the weight on squats that day. I'm curious about the specifics of this increase \u2013 was it a significant jump, or a more gradual progression? This helps assess the potential for recurrent injury.

Given the patient's numbness, tingling, and weakness, I want to rule out spinal stenosis, although the acute onset makes it less likely. Could we discuss the possibility of ordering an EMG/NCS study to assess the extent of nerve involvement and differentiate between radiculopathy and other peripheral neuropathies? Additionally, while rare, we should consider other causes of nerve root compression, such as an epidural abscess or tumor, especially if the patient's symptoms don't improve with conservative management. Although the patient denies fever, chills, and weight loss, I'd like to explore any history of immunosuppression or recent infections. Finally, I'm curious"

My primary reason for suggesting EMG/NCS wasn't to confirm the diagnosis of radiculopathy, but rather to establish a baseline for nerve function. This baseline data could be invaluable later if the patient's symptoms don't improve as expected or if new neurological deficits emerge. It could help differentiate between a progression of the disc herniation and other potential complications, such as nerve root fibrosis or the development of a peripheral neuropathy unrelated to the disc.

While this case *appears* straightforward, the patient did mention a sudden increase in squat weight. This raises the question of whether the herniation is the sole contributor to the radiculopathy, or if there's a component of acute nerve injury from the lifting incident itself. An early EMG/NCS could help differentiate between compression and more significant nerve damage, which might influence our prognosis and potentially even our initial treatment approach. For example, if the EMG/NCS reveals significant axonal damage, we might consider earlier surgical consultation, whereas a predominantly demyelinating pattern would support a more conservative approach. Furthermore, having baseline data would allow us to more accurately assess the effectiveness of conservative treatment and identify any subtle changes in nerve function over time.

I understand the principle of avoiding unnecessary testing, and I agree that in the vast majority of classic disc herniation cases, conservative management is the appropriate first step. However, I still have a couple of lingering thoughts regarding this specific patient. While the presentation is typical, the patient's description of a sudden, sharp pain during the deadlift, coupled with the reported increase in weight, suggests a potential for a more complex injury than a simple disc herniation. Could the sudden increase in weight have caused a more acute nerve injury, such as a stretch or partial tear, in addition to the compression from the herniation? This is where I believe an early EMG/NCS could provide valuable information. It wouldn't necessarily change our *initial* approach of conservative management, but it could help us predict the likely trajectory of recovery and identify patients who might benefit from earlier surgical intervention."

I'll contact the examining physician to clarify whether a thorough peripheral examination, perhaps with scleral depression, was performed and if any tears or areas of detachment were observed. Even if no detachment is currently present, the risk remains, so close monitoring for any changes in symptoms, especially new floaters or flashes of light, will be essential. Should we consider prophylactic laser photocoagulation if there are any peripheral retinal lesions predisposing to tears, even in the absence of a frank detachment?

No history of psoriasis has been reported, but I'll specifically ask the patient about any personal or family history of psoriasis or other skin conditions. Given the potential for psoriatic arthritis or other spondyloarthropathies, should we also consider testing for ANA and rheumatoid factor, even though the presentation isn't classic for RA? I'm also curious about your thoughts on ordering a uric acid level. While there's no mention of acute, severe pain or redness typically associated with gout, the migratory nature of the arthritis makes me want to rule it out. Regarding Lyme disease, I'll order the Lyme titer as we discussed. Should we also consider other tick-borne illnesses, like ehrlichiosis or babesiosis, given the potential overlap in symptoms?"

Given that we're broadening the infectious workup, should we also consider a parvovirus B19 IgM test? While it typically presents with a characteristic rash, it can also cause arthritis, and the migratory nature of this patient's joint pain makes me wonder.

Initial stool sample, blood work, ova and parasites, and calprotectin were all normal. No recent international travel, though the patient did mention a domestic camping trip a few months prior. No known food allergies or intolerances. The patient reports urgency and a few near accidents. No significant stressors reported. No family history of GI issues.

I was leaning towards a colonoscopy as the next step as well, to visualize the mucosa and obtain biopsies to evaluate for microscopic colitis and other potential pathologies. Before we proceed with the colonoscopy, I have a couple of questions: 1. Given the normal calprotectin, how high is your suspicion for microscopic colitis? Would you consider an empiric trial of bile acid sequestrants before the colonoscopy, or do you feel the colonoscopy is crucial at this stage given the duration of symptoms? 2. Are there any other less invasive tests you would consider before the colonoscopy, such as a SeHCAT scan (if available) to assess for BAD, or"

While an empiric trial of bile acid sequestrants is tempting, the potential delay in diagnosis outweighs the benefits, especially considering the possibility of microscopic colitis. Before we schedule the colonoscopy, I'd like to clarify a few things to optimize our approach: 1. Regarding the biopsies, should we target specific areas of the colon, or would you recommend random biopsies throughout the colon and terminal ileum? I'm particularly thinking about the right colon, given the yellowish stools, which might suggest a right-sided pathology. 2.

While microscopic colitis is high on our differential, are there any other less common conditions we should consider, given the chronic watery diarrhea and lack of other findings? For example, could this be a very subtle presentation of Crohn's disease, even with normal calprotectin? Or perhaps something like collagenous sprue, although that's quite rare? 2. Should we consider any additional blood tests prior to the colonoscopy, such as serological testing for celiac disease (even though the patient denies any family history) or a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess for electrolyte abnormalities given the chronic diarrhea? 3.

Symptoms onset was about a month ago with progressive worsening of dyspnea, particularly on exertion and when lying down. She also reports fatigue. Exam findings are significant for ascites and a right-sided pleural effusion. A pelvic ultrasound confirms a large right ovarian mass. Interestingly, her CA-125 is normal. My primary concern is ovarian malignancy, given the mass and ascites. However, the normal CA-125 is throwing me off. While elevated CA-125 is suggestive of ovarian cancer, a normal level doesn't rule it out, especially in younger patients. The pleural effusion also raises suspicion for metastatic spread. Other differentials I'm considering include: * **Benign ovarian tumors:** While less likely given the ascites and pleural effusion, fib"

The CT will provide more detail about the mass, assess for lymphadenopathy, and better characterize the pleural effusion. A biopsy is crucial for definitive diagnosis. Given the rapid progression of symptoms and the presence of the pleural effusion, I'm leaning towards a malignant process. While Meigs syndrome is a possibility, the size of the mass and the speed of symptom onset make it less probable in my view. Do you think a PET scan would be beneficial at this stage, or should we proceed directly with the biopsy after the CT? I'm wondering if a PET could help us better stage the disease if it is indeed malignant, and potentially identify any other occult sites of involvement. Also, given the patient's age, what histological subtypes of ovarian cancer are highest on your differential? Are there any specific tumor markers beyond CA-125 that"

Given the specialist's point about germ cell tumors being more common in younger patients, should we consider adding AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH to the pre-operative blood work? These markers could be elevated in certain germ cell tumors and might provide additional clues before the biopsy. Also, while we await the CT and biopsy results, are there any specific preoperative considerations we should address, given the ascites and pleural effusion? Should we consider a therapeutic paracentesis or thoracentesis for symptom relief, or would this potentially complicate the surgical planning?

While less commonly elevated than AFP or beta-hCG, it can be a useful marker, particularly for granulosa cell tumors, a subtype of sex cord-stromal tumors.

Assuming it *is* a germ cell tumor, which specific subtypes are most likely, given the rapid accumulation of ascites and the pleural effusion? Dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, or perhaps something else? Do any of these subtypes have a predilection for this pattern of spread? Also, are there any specific imaging characteristics on the upcoming CT scan that might help distinguish between these different possibilities?
