The patient reports mild dysphagia, which is also concerning. While the chest CT ruled out a thymoma, which is important, I'd like your opinion on a few things. First, given the relatively recent onset and the presence of bulbar symptoms (dysphagia, diplopia), what's your recommendation for initial management? I'm leaning towards starting pyridostigmine, but I'm also considering the need for early corticosteroid therapy given the bulbar involvement. What are your thoughts on that?

Should we aim for a specific symptom control target, or titrate based on patient tolerance and side effects? 2. While we're waiting for the thymectomy, are there any other supportive measures we should consider?

Should we also discuss a MedicAlert bracelet or similar identification? 3.

Regarding the pyridostigmine titration, should we set a maximum dose, or is it purely based on symptom control and tolerability? Some patients require higher doses, and I want to be sure we're not limiting the titration prematurely if they're tolerating the medication well but still experiencing some symptoms. 2. You mentioned pulmonary function tests (PFTs) for long-term monitoring. Given the patient's current mild dysphagia and the potential for respiratory involvement in MG, should we consider baseline PFTs now, rather than waiting for the first follow-up in 3-6 months? This could help us establish a baseline and potentially identify any early signs of respiratory compromise. 3. While the chest CT ruled out a thymoma, are there any other"

He hasn't been vomiting, which, while not ruling out Hirschsprung's, does make me consider other potential causes of obstruction, such as meconium ileus equivalent, even though he's a bit older than the typical presentation for that. I also considered intussusception, but the absence of currant jelly stools and the more chronic nature of this presentation make it less likely. I've ordered NPO and IV fluids as you suggested. Given the dilated bowel loops on x-ray, should we consider a lower GI series instead of a barium enema? I'm thinking it might provide a more comprehensive view and potentially identify the specific location of the obstruction. Also, while the rectal biopsy is essential for confirming Hirschsprung's, would a manometry study be helpful in this case? It could provide additional functional information about the bowel and help differentiate between Hirschsprung's and other motility disorders."

Could we try a gentle disimpaction with an osmotic laxative under close observation before resorting to a full-thickness biopsy? I'm hesitant to jump straight to a more invasive procedure if there's a chance this could be managed more conservatively.

The timeline of symptom onset after antibiotic use, the presence of flank pain, fever, and fatigue, along with the urinalysis findings showing leukocyturia and eosinophils (though without bacteria) all point towards this diagnosis. The absence of bacteria argues against a typical urinary tract infection. While the CBC is normal, that doesn't rule out AIN. My primary concern is the possibility of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, potentially to either the amoxicillin or the cephalexin. The rash with amoxicillin further supports this possibility. The fact that symptoms started a few days *after* discontinuation of the antibiotics is somewhat unusual, but not unheard of with delayed hypersensitivity reactions. I also considered other potential diagnoses, such as pyelonephritis, but the lack of bacteria in the urine and the presence of eosinophils makes"

While the timeline points towards the antibiotics, I want to be thorough in ruling out other potential culprits. Finally, what's your preferred steroid regimen for AIN in this type of scenario?

And what magnitude of change would you consider significant enough to warrant a biopsy? Regarding the other medications, while the timeline makes the antibiotics the primary suspects, I'm wondering about the potential for a synergistic effect. Could the combination of the antibiotics and one or more of the patient's other medications have increased the risk of AIN? Specifically, I'm thinking about the lisinopril, given its effects on the kidneys. Finally, on the prednisone regimen, what's your preferred tapering schedule after the initial 4-6 weeks? A slow taper seems prudent to minimize the risk of relapse, but I'd appreciate your specific recommendations."

One final question \u2013 while we agree that the antibiotics are the most likely culprits, I'd like to understand the potential interaction between lisinopril and AIN a bit better. While less likely to be the primary cause in this case, could lisinopril exacerbate pre-existing subclinical inflammation in the kidneys, potentially making the patient more susceptible to AIN triggered by the antibiotics? I'm particularly interested in this given the patient's history of hypertension, which could indicate underlying renal stress.

Before ordering the MRI, I wanted to get your perspective on a couple of other less likely, but still possible, diagnoses. Could this presentation be consistent with a pes anserine bursitis, or perhaps even a medial plica syndrome? While the tenderness seems to be more localized to the joint line rather than below it, I want to make sure we're considering all possibilities.

The patient didn't report any clicking, locking, or catching in the knee, which I understand can sometimes be present with meniscal tears. How much weight do you place on the absence of these symptoms in this particular case? Could a small, peripheral tear still be present even without these mechanical symptoms?

We need to ensure the surgical excision has adequate margins to minimize recurrence risk. 2. **Borderline Phyllodes Tumor:** This sits between benign and malignant and has a higher risk of local recurrence than a benign phyllodes. 3. **Benign Phyllodes Tumor:** Less likely given the rapid growth, but still possible.

Also, while I agree a CT could be helpful if the ultrasound is inconclusive and the patient doesn't respond to antibiotics, I'm a little hesitant to jump to a CT scan so quickly given the radiation exposure. Perhaps we could consider an MRI instead if further imaging is needed? It would offer better visualization of soft tissues and avoid the radiation. Finally, given the large baby mentioned in the history, I'm wondering if there was any difficulty with the delivery, such as prolonged labor or instrumental delivery (forceps or vacuum)?

Given the decreased bowel sounds and some nausea, could we also consider pelvic thrombophlebitis in the differential, albeit lower down the list? While it's less common, it can present with similar symptoms, and the large baby could be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism in general.

This further strengthens the likelihood of endometritis. While the D-dimer will help assess for thromboembolic risk, including pelvic thrombophlebitis, I'm wondering if we should also consider a Doppler ultrasound of the pelvic veins if the D-dimer is elevated or if she doesn't respond as expected to the antibiotics. This could help us definitively visualize any venous thrombosis in the pelvic region. What are your thoughts on that? Also, given the minor bibasilar crackles noted on the pulmonary exam, I'm slightly concerned about the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, although it seems less likely given the absence of respiratory distress and normal oxygen saturation"

Would you recommend any specific blood tests to help differentiate or assess for this, beyond the D-dimer and blood cultures already ordered?

Before we proceed with the sigmoidoscopy, I have a couple of further questions: 1. Considering the patient's description of the bleeding as \"more than just streaks,\" should we consider obtaining a hemoglobin level to assess for anemia?

This is a diagnostic test specifically used in neurology. * **MRI of the brain:** While normal, this imaging is crucial for ruling out other neurological causes for the patient's symptoms and is typically ordered and interpreted by a neuro"

She's unsure if the prenatal ultrasounds specifically screened for intestinal malformations. The infant is afebrile and doesn't appear to have respiratory distress. There's no known family history of GI issues. My primary concern is a congenital intestinal obstruction, possibly something like malrotation with volvulus, duodenal atresia, or less likely, Hirschsprung's disease given the proximal nature of the vomiting. The bilious emesis suggests the obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater. The lack of meconium passage further supports an obstructive process.

While duodenal atresia is also a possibility, the timing of presentation, with vomiting starting a day after birth, makes me lean slightly more towards volvulus. Duodenal atresia often presents with vomiting within the first few hours of life. Should we consider obtaining a contrast enema en route, or should we wait until arrival at the surgical center?

Just to clarify my reasoning for leaning towards malrotation with volvulus \u2013 while the bilious vomiting could be present in both volvulus and duodenal atresia, the fact that the baby tolerated some feeds initially and then the vomiting started a day after birth makes me suspect a volvulus might have occurred after the initial feeds. With duodenal atresia, we'd typically expect more immediate and persistent vomiting from birth. While we await the upper GI series, should we preemptively administer any antibiotics given the risk of bowel ischemia if it is a volvulus? And what are your thoughts on a NG tube for decompression during transport? I'm assuming that would be beneficial. Finally, while less likely given the presentation, should we still consider Hirschsprung's disease in the differential, or are the current findings sufficient to rule that out for now?"

The patient presents with a classic mallet finger presentation: inability to actively extend the DIP joint, passive extension possible but doesn't hold, pain at the DIP joint, swelling, and a history of a jamming injury. The negative X-ray ruled out a fracture, and I expected the ultrasound to confirm a tendon injury, specifically to the extensor tendon. Yet, it came back normal. My primary diagnosis remains mallet finger, but the normal ultrasound makes me consider other possibilities. I'd like your opinion on a few points: 1. **Could the ultrasound have missed a partial tendon tear?** Is it possible the resolution wasn't sufficient to detect a subtle tear, especially if it's small or intrasubstance? 2. **Should we consider a central slip injury?** While less likely given the mechanism of injury and the lack of PIP joint"

Before we order that, I have a couple more questions. 1. Given the normal ultrasound, how likely is it that we're dealing with a purely ligamentous injury, like a volar plate avulsion, rather than a tendon injury? The mechanism of injury (jamming the finger) could certainly cause this. While the patient doesn't report significant instability, could a small avulsion be contributing to the inability to extend the DIP? 2. You mentioned tendon subluxation. Are there any specific maneuvers or physical exam findings I could re-evaluate the patient for that might suggest this, even in the absence of positive imaging findings so far? Is there a particular way to stress the extensor tendon that might reveal subtle subluxation? 3. Assuming the MRI confirms a partial extensor tendon"

I'm trying to balance diagnostic accuracy with cost-effectiveness. 2. **Splinting specifics:** Assuming the MRI confirms a partial tear, what type of splint would you recommend? A volar splint, a stack splint, or something else? And for how long would you typically immobilize the DIP joint in this scenario? Should the PIP joint also be immobilized? 3. **Surgical threshold:** You mentioned discussing surgical options for a significant tear.

Could we consider a very brief, supervised removal period once daily for skin checks and gentle cleaning, ensuring meticulous reapplication of the splint immediately afterward? Or would even this minimal interruption compromise healing? 2. **Alternative diagnoses:** Given the negative ultrasound, while a partial tear remains the most likely diagnosis, are there any other extremely rare differentials we should keep in mind, even if just for thoroughness? For example, could a localized inflammatory process mimicking a tendon injury be a possibility, even if unlikely? Or perhaps an unusual presentation of a nerve compression syndrome, although the patient denies paresthesias? I"

The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and lightheadedness, all starting shortly after antibiotic initiation, strongly suggest this. The absence of blood in the stool is also consistent with CDI, though doesn't rule out other possibilities. Given the patient's report of lightheadedness, I'm concerned about dehydration. While the urine color is reportedly normal, the frequency of bowel movements and reduced oral intake are still worrying. My initial differential includes: 1. **CDI:** This is my top differential given the classic presentation. 2. **Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non-CDI):** While CDI is the most concerning cause, other gut flora disruptions due to levofloxacin could be contributing. 3. **Viral"

I'm hesitant to stop it abruptly without an alternative antibiotic in place. Could we discuss options for covering the pneumonia while minimizing the risk of exacerbating the diarrhea? Perhaps a narrow-spectrum antibiotic with less impact on gut flora? What are your thoughts on that? Also, while CDI is the most likely diagnosis, I'd like to consider other less common possibilities. Given the patient's age (which I haven't explicitly stated but should have included in the initial presentation - let's assume the patient is 45 years old and otherwise healthy), could microscopic colitis be a consideration?

Firstly, regarding the *C. difficile* toxin test, should we also consider PCR testing for the *C. difficile* organism itself? I understand toxin testing is the gold standard, but PCR can sometimes pick up cases where toxin production is low. What's your preference in this scenario? Secondly, you mentioned microscopic colitis. If the *C. difficile* tests are negative and the diarrhea persists despite stopping the levofloxacin and starting azithromycin, what would be the next step in evaluating for microscopic colitis?

Just to confirm my understanding of the plan: we treat empirically for CDI while awaiting the toxin test results. If the toxin test is positive, we'll continue appropriate CDI treatment. If negative, we complete the azithromycin course and observe for resolution of diarrhea. If the diarrhea persists despite completing azithromycin and stopping levofloxacin, we proceed with a colonoscopy with biopsies to evaluate for microscopic colitis. Correct?

While arterial ulcers can also be painful, the dependency aspect points more towards a venous etiology. * **Diabetes:** Diabetes significantly increases the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and can impair wound healing, making infections more likely. Both PAD and diabetic foot ulcers are managed by vascular surgeons. * **Swelling in the ankles and cold feet:** These are further signs of potential circulatory problems in the lower extremities, reinforcing the need for vascular expertise."

The location on the outer side of the lower leg, the dark purplish edge, and the lack of discharge, combined with the reported pain, coldness, and swelling in the affected foot, all point towards a possible arterial insufficiency ulcer. The patient's report that the pain is worse when the leg is dependent and improves with elevation further supports this. While the patient denies a history of peripheral artery disease, their diabetes puts them at significant risk. The initial presentation resembling an insect bite could have been a minor skin break that failed to heal due to compromised blood supply. My primary differential diagnosis is an arterial ulcer. However, other possibilities need to be considered. Given the patient's Crohn's disease, could pyoderma gangrenosum be a factor, even though the description doesn't perfectly fit the classic"

I'm hesitant to biopsy if revascularization is likely, as it could complicate healing. Perhaps we could hold off on the biopsy unless the ulcer fails to improve with improved blood flow. Also, given the patient is on mesalamine, could this be a drug-induced ulceration, although I haven't found literature linking mesalamine to this type of presentation.

Also, given the patient's diabetes, I'm going to consult with Endocrinology to ensure optimal glycemic control, as this will be crucial for wound healing regardless of the underlying cause.

While placental abruption is less likely given the localized pain and ultrasound findings, could the specialist comment on whether the ultrasound showed any retro-placental hematoma or other signs suggestive of abruption, even if not the primary diagnosis? This would help further solidify our understanding. Also, while unlikely at 38 weeks, could we completely rule out uterine dehiscence rather than a complete rupture? Is there anything in the ultrasound findings that definitively distinguishes between the two? I understand the clinical presentation strongly suggests a full rupture, but I want to be thorough.

While we haven't discussed it explicitly, I assume given the patient's hemodynamic instability (tachycardia and hypotension) that we're initiating aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids and possibly blood products already? 2. Regarding the potential for hysterectomy, are there any specific intraoperative findings, besides uncontrollable bleeding, that would definitively guide the decision towards hysterectomy versus repair? For instance, is the extent of the rupture, the involvement of major vessels, or the condition of the uterine tissue itself key factors to consider? Knowing these parameters will help the surgical team make the best decision in real-time. 3. Finally, while less likely given the acute nature of"

Are there any other features we should look for with CMV, such as perivascular exudates or granular lesions?

Given the patient's rapid decline in vision over just 48 hours, and considering the funduscopic characteristics we've discussed, I'm leaning towards CMV retinitis or possibly PORN as the most likely diagnoses. While awaiting the lab results, and given the patient's low CD4 count and the aggressive nature of these potential diagnoses, I believe initiating empiric treatment for CMV retinitis is warranted upon admission.

We have a patient presenting with acute right knee pain and swelling of about 12 days duration, with a sharp, throbbing character, worsened by weight-bearing.

Additionally, they describe burning pain with urination for a few weeks and recent onset of conjunctivitis. They are sexually active with multiple recent partners. My initial concern, given the constellation of symptoms \u2013 the arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis \u2013 is reactive arthritis, particularly given the recent sexual activity. The absence of fever, chills, or night sweats argues somewhat against a septic arthritis, though we can't entirely rule it out.

The shortness of breath is exertional, with occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but no orthopnea. She denies chest pain. The abdominal distension is non-painful, described more as pressure. She denies weight change, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. The initial blood work showed normal CBC. The CA-125 is normal, which is somewhat reassuring, but certainly doesn't rule out malignancy. A chest x-ray revealed a right-sided pleural effusion, and an abdominal ultrasound confirmed a large ovarian mass and significant ascites. We haven't yet received results for the liver function tests, paracentesis, or coagulation panel, which I've ordered. My primary concern is ovarian cancer with peritoneal spread leading to the ascites and pleural"

I agree about further imaging of the chest and pleura. A CT chest would be helpful to better characterize the effusion and look for any other potential metastatic sites. My question is, given the normal CA-125, what's your level of suspicion for a borderline ovarian tumor or another less common ovarian neoplasm? While a normal CA-125 doesn't exclude malignancy, it does make me consider other possibilities. Would you recommend any additional tumor markers at this stage, such as HE4, or should we proceed directly to biopsy? Also, regarding the paracentesis"

I know it's classically associated with elevated CA-125, but I'm wondering if it could be a variant presentation. Additionally, are there any specific immunohistochemical stains you would recommend for the ovarian biopsy, considering the differential diagnosis at this point? Finally, given her young age, should we be considering germ cell tumors in the differential, and if so, are there any specific markers we should be looking for in the biopsy or blood work, such as AFP or beta-hCG?"

Regarding the immunohistochemistry markers you suggested (WT1, p53, and ER/PR), are there any specific subtypes of ovarian cancer you are particularly suspicious of based on the current presentation? I'm also curious about your thoughts on the optimal biopsy approach. Given the ascites, would you recommend a laparoscopic biopsy, or would an image-guided core needle biopsy be sufficient for diagnosis and staging? I'm leaning towards laparoscopy to allow for better visualization and potentially more comprehensive tissue sampling, but I'm open to your perspective. Finally, assuming the biopsy confirms malignancy, what are your initial thoughts on next steps in terms of staging and treatment planning? Would you recommend referral to a gynecologic oncologist at this point,"

Firstly, while we suspect a high-grade serous carcinoma, the normal CA-125 and the patient's age make me want to thoroughly explore other possibilities. Given the ascites and pleural effusion, could we be dealing with a primary peritoneal carcinoma, which can mimic ovarian cancer? Should we consider obtaining biopsies of the peritoneum during the laparoscopy to investigate this possibility? Secondly, you mentioned germ cell tumors. While the patient's age makes this a consideration, are there any specific imaging characteristics on the ultrasound that would suggest a germ cell tumor over an epithelial ovarian cancer?
