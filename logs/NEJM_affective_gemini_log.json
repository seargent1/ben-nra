I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of melasma given the symmetrical bluish-brown discoloration on sun-exposed areas, the leathery texture change, the patient's perimenopausal state, and the fact that it started gradually a year or so before she began using hydroquinone. The negative ACTH stimulation test and normal iron studies ruled out Addison's disease and hemochromatosis. However, the patient's continued use of hydroquinone for two years with limited improvement raises some questions. While melasma can be resistant to treatment, I'd like to explore a few things. First, I'm curious about the specific hydroquinone formulation she's using \u2013 the concentration and any other ingredients. Some formulations are more effective than others. Second, has she been compliant with strict sun protection? This is crucial in managing melasma, and even intermittent sun exposure can hinder progress. Third, are there"

That's a crucial point given the prolonged hydroquinone use and the somewhat unusual leathery texture she described. I'll arrange for a biopsy of the affected skin. I agree that exploring retinoid use is important. I'll ask the patient if she's used any topical or systemic retinoids, either prescribed or over-the-counter, alongside the hydroquinone. Combining retinoids with hydroquinone can sometimes boost effectiveness, but it also increases the risk of irritation, so it's important to know if she's been using them. Could the bluish-brown discoloration, which is more typical of dermal melasma, be contributing to the perceived lack of response to the hydroquinone? Superficial epidermal melasma tends to respond better to topical treatments. Also, while we've ruled out Addison's and hemochromatosis, could there be other underlying hormonal imbalances contributing to the me"

The irregular menses could suggest a hormonal imbalance, and while less likely to be directly causing the hyperpigmentation, it could be a contributing factor. I'll order a TSH and free T4 test. Given the possibility of dermal melasma, which as you mentioned is more resistant to topical hydroquinone, I'm wondering if we should consider alternative or adjunctive treatments if the biopsy rules out exogenous ochronosis. What are your thoughts on topical corticosteroids, triple combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and a corticosteroid), or perhaps laser therapies like fractional lasers or intense pulsed light (IPL)?

Before we proceed with those, I want to confirm a few things based on your experience. In your opinion, with the patient having used hydroquinone for two years, is a trial of a triple combination cream, even with a lower concentration of hydroquinone, still a reasonable approach, or would you recommend discontinuing hydroquinone altogether for a period before trying the triple combination?

Before we conclude, I have a few final clarifying questions. Regarding the biopsy, is there a specific location you'd recommend for the biopsy site, considering the distribution of the discoloration? Should I target an area with the most prominent leathery texture change, or is a more representative sample from a less thickened area sufficient? Also, regarding the triple combination cream, do you have a preferred formulation or concentration you recommend starting with, considering she's been using hydroquinone for a prolonged period?

The methacholine challenge is a good point too, especially if the initial spirometry and bronchodilator trial are unrevealing. Given the six-month duration of the cough, should we also consider a high-resolution CT scan of the chest? While the chest x-ray is a good starting point, a CT scan could potentially identify subtle interstitial lung disease or other abnormalities not visible on a plain film. I'm thinking specifically about things like sarcoidosis or even early-stage fibrosis, although I acknowledge the lack of other supporting symptoms makes these less likely. Also, regarding the laryngoscopy, should we proceed with that regardless of the spirometry and bronchodilator trial results, or should we wait and see if those provide any direction first?

While I agree that IVLBCL is the most likely diagnosis, the persistently negative imaging and (presumed) negative peripheral blood are perplexing. Could the atypical lymphocytes seen in the skin biopsy represent a cutaneous lymphoma, mimicking IVLBCL? Or perhaps a reactive process, although the extremely elevated LDH argues against this.

The dyspnea is described as air hunger rather than chest tightness or wheezing. She also reports occasional episodes of coughing up pink-tinged sputum. While she denies peripheral edema, the persistent bloating raises concern. There's no significant weight change and no known family history of heart disease. Her activity level has decreased due to the worsening dyspnea. Given the constellation of symptoms, my primary concern is heart failure, potentially diastolic dysfunction given the preserved ejection fraction implied by the lack of weight gain and peripheral edema. The pink-tinged sputum, however, raises the possibility of mitral valve involvement or even pulmonary hypertension. Other differentials include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though the lack of a smoking history and the nature of the dyspnea make this less likely."

We've also explored environmental factors like chemical exposure, heavy metals, and arsenic, but the patient denies any such contact. My primary concern is the combination of dermatological and neurological symptoms. While the normal nerve conduction studies"

This falls squarely within the realm of dermatology. The doctor's initial suspicion of Granuloma Faciale, a skin condition, further reinforces this. Although neurological symptoms emerged, they were secondary to the initial skin complaint. The normal nerve conduction study and EMG results lessened the likelihood of a primary neurological disorder.

I agree that sunrise views would be helpful to better visualize the patella and its relationship to the femoral trochlea. I'll order those along with an MRI of both knees as you suggested, focusing on the quadriceps and patellar tendons. Checking creatinine kinase is also a good idea to assess for any ongoing muscle damage, although I suspect it might be normal given the chronicity.

The contrast MRI is a definite must, and I'll add Vitamin D levels to the lab work. Given the potential for electrolyte imbalances and Vitamin D deficiency contributing to the weakness, and considering the somewhat atypical presentation for amyloidosis, I'd like to explore a few more things before the MRI, just to be thorough. Could the patient's hemodialysis itself be a contributing factor? Are there any known musculoskeletal complications of long-term hemodialysis that could mimic this presentation, perhaps related to calcium-phosphate metabolism or beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis? I want to make sure we're not missing something related to the dialysis process itself. Also, while the patient denies a family history of joint problems, I'm wondering about a possible underlying myopathy, given the quadriceps weakness and the somewhat unusual presentation."

The fungal infection is a good point, especially considering the toenail changes. Even with the negative scrape, a fungal culture would be a prudent next step, as you suggested. Could the back rash be a dermatophytid reaction, a distant manifestation of the suspected toenail fungus? This might explain the negative scraping on the back.

Could we consider a repeat scraping, perhaps from a different area of the rash, or a trial of permethrin cream to see if there's any clinical improvement, even in the absence of definitive evidence of scabies?

They have a history of asthma and allergies, and report a significant increase in albuterol use over the past few months, suggesting worsening respiratory symptoms. Given the chronicity and the systemic symptoms like fever, chills, and night sweats, I was concerned about something more than just an asthma exacerbation, perhaps a chronic bronchitis or even pneumonia. The normal PFTs throw a wrench in that thinking. My initial differential included: * **Asthma exacerbation:** This is still high on the list given the history of asthma and increased inhaler use. However, the normal PFTs and the presence of fever, chills, and night sweats make this less likely. *"

The patient's history of allergies makes eosinophilic pneumonia a reasonable consideration. Before we jump to a CT, would you consider a complete blood count (CBC) and perhaps a blood culture to further assess for infection? Also, given the chronic nature of the cough, could we be looking at something like bronchiectasis? While the PFTs were normal, it might be worth considering if there's localized disease not reflected in global lung function. Perhaps a high-resolution CT chest would be more informative than a standard chest x-ray if the x-ray doesn't provide a clear answer? Finally, I'm curious about the patient's allergy history.

Even if the chest x-ray is normal, could we be dealing with small airways disease that isn't being picked up by standard spirometry? I'm thinking specifically about bronchiolitis, perhaps an infectious or inflammatory variant. Would you consider a FeNO test (fractional exhaled nitric oxide) to assess for eosinophilic airway inflammation, even with normal PFTs? It might provide additional information about airway inflammation not reflected in the PFTs. Also, given the patient's history of asthma, could this be a form of non-eosinophilic asthma,"

Assuming the chest x-ray, CBC, and cultures are unremarkable, and the patient responds to the oral corticosteroids, would you then consider a diagnosis of asthma with a prominent cough variant?

However, the standard tests haven't definitively confirmed this yet. Adding to the complexity, the patient also describes a horizontal groove and an inward turning of the lower eyelids, with associated discomfort, a scratching sensation, and excessive tearing. This sounds like entropion. Interestingly, Schirmer's test showed normal tear production, ruling out dry eye as a primary contributor to the irritation.

The findings of anemia, hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), and a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) strongly suggest autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA is a condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. This destruction of red blood cells leads to anemia, jaundice (from the breakdown product of hemoglobin called bilirubin), and can also cause fatigue and itching.

So, to summarize our plan: we're monitoring hemoglobin, reticulocytes, and bilirubin, with a hemoglobin of 8 g/dL as our trigger for prednisone. We're also adding folic acid and hydration. We'll hold off on rituximab pending the cold agglutinin titer, Mycoplasma, and EBV results. If the cold agglutinin titer is strongly positive *and* either Mycoplasma or EBV are positive, we'll treat the infection and manage the AIHA, forgoing the CT scan. Now, a couple of remaining questions for my own clarity: 1. If the cold agglutinin titer is positive, but the infectious workup is negative, should we still proceed with the CT scan to rule out lymphoma, even if the patient is otherwise responding well to supportive care? I'm thinking this scenario might warrant"

AIHA is a condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. This destruction of red blood cells leads to anemia, jaundice (from the breakdown product of hemoglobin called bilirubin), and can also cause fatigue and itching. Hematologists specialize in blood disorders, including anemia, and are best equipped to diagnose and manage AIHA.

However, subsequent urine microscopy for parasites and eosinophils, as well as Schistosomiasis serology, returned normal. This fluctuating picture is puzzling. My primary concern is the possibility of something we've missed. The initial eosinophilia was quite striking, and while the negative parasitic workup is reassuring, I'm wondering if the intermittent nature of the hematuria might mean we've sampled at a time when eosinophils weren't present in the urine.

Before we proceed with something as invasive as a cystoscopy in a young patient, I'd like to explore a few more non-invasive options and gather some additional information. First, given the intermittent nature of the symptoms, could this be related to exercise or physical activity? Has the patient been queried specifically about any strenuous activities preceding episodes of hematuria?

Or should we wait until after the repeat laryngoscopy to implement these changes, so as not to confound the follow-up assessment?

Also, while the patient denies any new medications, he did mention using a \"generic sore cream\" on the lesions. Do you think it's worth exploring this further? Could this cream be contributing to the problem, perhaps through contact dermatitis or"

I'll also ask him to bring in the generic sore cream so we can analyze the ingredients. Regarding international travel, I didn't specifically ask him about that, but I will at the next appointment. Given the possibility of contact dermatitis, should patch testing be considered as well? Also, while we're broadening the differential, should we consider any autoimmune conditions like pemphigus vulgaris or bullous pemphigoid, even though the presentation seems somewhat atypical? Finally, given the patient's report of stress exacerbating the sores, could there be a psychosomatic component to this? I'm thinking along the lines of stress-induced recurrent genital herpes simplex, even though the HSV tests were negative. Could false negative HSV tests be a possibility in a small percentage of cases, or are there other herpesviruses that could be causing this presentation?"

The rarity of false-negative HSV PCR, especially with recurrent lesions, is reassuring, and I appreciate you weighing in on the likelihood of other herpesviruses. Given your suggestion about psychogenic excoriations, and the patient's mention of stress exacerbating the sores, I'm wondering if we should explore this avenue further. While he describes itching preceding the lesions, could he be subconsciously exacerbating minor irritations into full-blown sores due to stress? Perhaps a referral to a dermatologist or even a psychologist for evaluation might be beneficial, especially if the other tests we've discussed (syphilis, *M. genitalium*, LGV, and the biopsy) come back negative. Regarding the biopsy, should we be considering any specific stains or tests beyond routine histopathology? Are there any particular markers that"

I'll hold off on the psychology referral for now but keep it in mind if we hit a diagnostic roadblock. Before we wrap up, I wanted to clarify a couple of things. Given the patient's description of the sores starting as small bumps, I'm wondering if we should consider molluscum contagiosum, even though it's more common in children. Is it worth testing for this, or is the presentation and chronicity not typical? Also, regarding the timing of the biopsy, you mentioned active lesion is preferred. Should I instruct the patient to contact us immediately upon the onset of a new lesion so we can schedule the biopsy as quickly as possible? What's the ideal timeframe for obtaining the biopsy sample to maximize diagnostic yield? Finally, while I agree that false-"

While a dermatologist might seem appropriate due to the skin sores, the cyclical nature of the symptoms, the initial suspicion of HSV (a sexually transmitted infection), and the tender groin glands point towards a potential infectious cause. Even though the initial HSV tests were negative, other STIs or unusual infections could be responsible for the recurring sores. An infectious disease specialist has the expertise to investigate less common infections and conduct more specialized testing beyond a standard STI panel. They are best equipped to diagnose and manage complex or recurring infections that may not be readily apparent."
