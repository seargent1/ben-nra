The patient presents with a classic picture of myasthenia gravis (MG), with fluctuating muscle weakness worsening with exertion and improving with rest. The symptoms include diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, proximal limb weakness, and now the reported shortness of breath. The positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, along with the positive Tensilon test (implied by the ordering of the test and subsequent diagnosis), and decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation on EMG solidify this diagnosis. The normal chest CT scan rules out thymoma, which is important for prognosis and management. My main concern now is the reported shortness of breath, even if it's only with exertion. This raises the possibility of myasthenic crisis, or at least impending respiratory compromise. I'd like to understand the severity and frequency of this shortness of breath better.

I was concerned enough about the potential for respiratory compromise that I wanted to consult with you before proceeding. Given the relatively recent onset of symptoms and the now present, albeit exertional, dyspnea, I'm leaning towards admitting the patient for closer monitoring and initiation of treatment. While MG is the most likely diagnosis, are there any other differentials we should consider at this stage, even if less probable? I'm thinking specifically about Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), although the lack of autonomic symptoms and the presence of ocular symptoms make it less likely. Could the shortness of breath be related to another process entirely, given the normal chest CT? Should we consider other neuromuscular junction disorders or even a primary pulmonary issue, albeit a less likely scenario"

The absence of other autonomic symptoms commonly seen in botulism, such as fixed dilated pupils, dry mouth (though the patient does report this, it fits within the MG picture as well), and constipation, also makes it less likely. To differentiate further, could we inquire about the patient's recent dietary history, specifically regarding any potential exposure to improperly canned or preserved foods? Also, has the patient experienced any other neurological symptoms like blurred vision distinct from the diplopia, or any gastrointestinal symptoms preceding the onset of weakness? While a primary pulmonary issue is less likely, the shortness of breath does warrant further investigation.

Given the patient's report of dry mouth and eyes, which could be consistent with either MG or botulism (though less common in the former), I think it's prudent to also ask about any recent use of over-the-counter medications, particularly antihistamines or decongestants, as these could contribute to dryness and potentially confound the picture. Regarding the respiratory symptoms, while a chest x-ray, FVC, and ABGs are planned, I'm wondering if a baseline sleep study might also be beneficial.

I'll send the films over shortly and schedule the rectal biopsy. Before we do, I have a couple of questions. First, given the patient's age and the relatively acute presentation, did you see anything in the contrast enema that suggests total colonic aganglionosis or any other variant of Hirschsprung's? While classic Hirschsprung's disease typically involves the rectosigmoid colon, I want to be sure we're considering all possibilities. Second, have you had any experience with delayed presentations of Hirschsprung's at this age? While not unheard of, it's less common than the neonatal presentation. I'm wondering if there might be any other contributing factors we should consider, even if Hirschsprung's is confirmed. Finally, regarding surgical options, do you typically perform a pull-through procedure in"

Given the possibility of a longer segment being involved, are you leaning towards a specific pull-through procedure at this point, such as the Soave, Swenson, or Duhamel procedure? Or do you prefer to make that decision definitively after the biopsy and intraoperative findings? Also, in cases of delayed presentation like this, do you typically perform a diverting colostomy initially before the definitive pull-through? I'm wondering about the potential benefits of bowel decompression prior to the pull-through in this scenario, given the current distension.

I agree that COO testing isn't necessary at this point, reserving it for potential relapse or refractory disease. Before we definitively settle on R-CHOP, I'd like to confirm a few things and explore a couple of additional points: 1. **Cardiac Risk Stratification Details:** Could you elaborate on what specific cardiac risk factors would push us towards dose-adjusted EPOCH-R? I want to ensure we're using the most appropriate criteria for this decision. Should we obtain a baseline MUGA scan or cardiac MRI in addition to the echocardiogram, especially if there's any history of prior cardiac issues or significant risk factors? 2. **Baseline Renal Function:** R-CHOP can also impact renal function. Have we obtained a baseline creatinine and estimated GFR? This will be important for dosing adjustments and monitoring throughout treatment"

This constellation of findings, particularly the eosinophils and negative culture, points towards acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient also confirmed ibuprofen use during the illness, which further strengthens this suspicion as NSAIDs are a common cause of AIN. While the antibiotics themselves could also be the culprit, the eosinophils make drug-induced AIN from the NSAIDs more likely. My primary differential diagnosis is acute interstitial nephritis, likely drug-induced. Less likely, given the negative urine culture and eosinophils, is pyelonephritis.

Given her history and exam findings, my initial differential includes pes anserine bursitis, medial meniscus tear, and medial plica syndrome. Less likely, given the lack of a specific traumatic event and negative ligamentous testing, are MCL sprain or patellar subluxation.

In your experience, is this tenderness more suggestive of pes anserine bursitis, or could it also be present in a medial meniscus tear or medial plica syndrome? I'm trying to gauge how much weight to put on that specific finding. Also, given her relatively sedentary lifestyle prior to this increase in activity, would you consider recommending a gradual return to activity even after the pain subsides, perhaps with some preventative exercises to strengthen the supporting muscles around the knee?

Syncope can be caused by various underlying conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias or other heart problems. Even though the ECG came back normal, a cardiologist can perform more thorough cardiac evaluations to definitively rule out any underlying heart issues as a cause for the syncope. While micturition syncope is often benign, it's crucial to eliminate potentially serious cardiac causes before settling on that diagnosis."

I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of micturition syncope, given the circumstances of the event (post-urination, witnessed brief LOC, quick recovery without sequelae), the patient's report of occasional lightheadedness with a strong urge to urinate, and the normal ECG, blood tests, and tilt table test. However, I wanted to consult with you to ensure we haven't missed anything from a cardiovascular perspective. The patient reports consuming a moderate amount of alcohol and caffeine, denies palpitations, and hasn't experienced syncope in other situations. Do you think the normal tilt table test sufficiently rules out orthostatic hypotension or other causes of neurally mediated syncope, given that this event was specifically related to urination? Are there any other cardiac investigations you would recommend at this stage, or do you concur with the likely diagnosis of micturition syncope?"

Could the act of holding urine for prolonged periods, as the patient admits to sometimes doing, exacerbate any underlying predisposition to vasovagal responses? Could this be a mixed picture, with elements of both micturition syncope and situational syncope related to the Valsalva maneuver-like effect of holding urine?

While his current intake seems moderate, even moderate amounts could potentially exacerbate dehydration or contribute to a vasovagal response, especially in the context of urination. Also, regarding further investigation if the Holter shows abnormalities: what specific findings would you consider concerning enough to warrant further investigation? For example, would occasional premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), if asymptomatic, be cause for concern in this context, or would we primarily be looking for more significant arrhythmias like runs of tachycardia or bradycardia?

These could help us identify conditions like urea cycle defects or organic acidemias, which can present with non-specific symptoms like lethargy and poor feeding. Regarding congenital heart disease, are there any specific cardiac lesions you'd be most suspicious of in this scenario? Should we prioritize an echocardiogram even before we have other results back? I'm thinking particularly about ductal-dependent lesions that might be starting to"

To help refine our diagnostic approach further, I have a few more questions: 1. **Regarding the timing of the echocardiogram and metabolic screening:** Should we perform these concurrently, or should one take precedence? My inclination is to do the echocardiogram first, given the potential for immediate life-threatening complications with some cardiac defects. 2. **Sepsis workup:** While we're pursuing these other avenues, we shouldn't delay the sepsis workup and blood cultures. Do you have any specific recommendations for the antibiotic regimen, considering the patient's neonatal status? I'm thinking ampicillin and gentamicin initially,"

The mammogram clearly shows a polylobulated mass, suggestive of a possible fibroadenoma or even a phyllodes tumor given the rapid growth. However, the normal ultrasound makes me question those initial impressions. It's unusual for a solid mass seen on mammogram to be completely missed on ultrasound. My primary differential diagnoses at this point, in order of likelihood, are: 1. **Fibroadenoma:** While the rapid growth is atypical for a typical fibroadenoma, it's still possible, especially in younger women. The smooth, mobile nature described by the patient also supports this. The negative ultrasound is the main point against this diagnosis. 2. **Phyllodes tumor:** The rapid growth is a red flag and raises concern for a phyllodes tumor, which can be benign or malignant."

Could the mass seen on mammogram represent a large intraductal papilloma, perhaps explaining the negative ultrasound if it's primarily fluid-filled?

While we await the CBC and urinalysis results, my primary concern is postpartum endometritis. Given the vaginal delivery and the large baby, there's likely been some trauma to the uterine lining, increasing the risk of infection. My differential diagnosis also includes: * **Retained placental fragments:** This can cause similar symptoms and needs to be ruled out. Did the placenta appear intact at delivery? Was a manual exploration of the uterus performed? * **Urinary tract infection (UTI):** While less likely given the localized uterine tenderness and nature of the lochia, a UTI can occur postpartum and contribute to fever."

And should we consider transvaginal ultrasound for a better view of the endometrium and surrounding structures? 2. **Regarding the patient's history:** We need more information about the delivery itself. I'll ensure we obtain details about the duration of ruptured membranes, length of labor, any instrumentation used (forceps or vacuum), and the presence or absence of meconium.

A transvaginal ultrasound will be ordered to assess for retained products, fluid collections, and evaluate the endometrial lining. Given the patient's persistent fever and localized tenderness, while we strongly suspect endometritis, I want to be thorough in ruling out other less common but serious postpartum infections. Could we also consider adding pelvic thrombophlebitis to the differential diagnosis? Although she denies leg pain or swelling currently, pelvic thrombophlebitis can sometimes present with fever and lower abdominal pain without prominent lower extremity findings initially. Should we consider a D-dimer test, or perhaps even a CT venogram if the clinical picture remains unclear despite the initial ultrasound?"

They are also best equipped to perform procedures like colonoscopies if deemed necessary for further investigation, especially given the presence of blood in the stool. Even though the symptoms ultimately pointed to a benign cause, the initial presentation warranted the involvement of a specialist trained in diagnosing and managing a wider range of digestive and lower GI tract issues."

My DRE revealed a prolapsed, non-tender mass easily reducible back into the anal canal. Anoscopy confirmed internal hemorrhoids. The patient's vital signs are stable, and CBC is normal. Bowel movements are of normal consistency and caliber, once daily, with no pain or straining reported. The patient denies any mucus in the stool, recent travel, or changes in diet. They do report some discomfort during bowel movements, but no itching. This is their first experience with hemorrhoids, and they deny any significant stressors.

The patient denies any family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Did the initial report mentioning a palpable mass indicate its size or location within the rectum? Knowing this might help assess the risk of a more serious underlying issue. Also, while the patient reports no change in bowel habits, has there been any history of constipation or straining in the past that might predispose them to hemorrhoids?"

Given the specialist's concern and the lack of clarity regarding the initial mass, I'd like to explore a couple of additional points before the sigmoidoscopy. First, while the patient denies current straining, could we consider adding a fecal calprotectin test to the workup? This could help rule out any underlying inflammatory process, even in the absence of other suggestive symptoms. Second, I'd like to ask the patient specifically about any history of anal fissures.

While I will schedule the sigmoidoscopy, would you consider a full colonoscopy instead? My reasoning is this: if the initial mass was higher up in the rectum or even in the sigmoid colon, a sigmoidoscopy might miss it.

I haven't been able to assess reflexes or perform a thorough sensory exam yet. My primary concern is the persistent diminished pulse and numbness despite normal Doppler and ABI. Could this be due to compression from hematoma formation around the sciatic nerve, even without obvious signs on the CT? Or perhaps a transient vasospasm related to the dislocation?

While a hematoma or vasospasm are plausible, I'd like to explore other less common possibilities. Could the diminished pulse and numbness be related to a subtle intimal tear in the femoral artery, not readily apparent on the initial imaging? While a full-blown dissection would likely show up on the CT angiogram, a small tear might be missed.

It's a low-risk procedure with potentially high reward in this scenario. Regarding the post-reduction management, a hip brace for 6-8 weeks sounds appropriate.

The mother reports the abdomen feels firm and the baby cries, seemingly in discomfort, especially after feeding and when straining, as if to pass a stool. Prenatal ultrasounds were reportedly normal, and the mother denies any significant illnesses or medications during pregnancy. We've obtained an abdominal X-ray which shows dilated bowel loops and no gas in the rectum, pointing towards a distal bowel obstruction.

If the enema doesn't show a transition zone or dislodge a meconium plug, and the biopsy doesn't confirm Hirschsprung's, then IND becomes a stronger possibility, although the biopsy might offer some clues. I'll order the contrast enema and arrange for a surgical consult now, given the likelihood of needing intervention. We'll start the IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics as you recommended.

Before we conclude, I just want to confirm a few management points and address a couple of less likely, but important differentials. Given the patient\u2019s age and the possibility of Hirschsprung\u2019s, I assume we should hold off on any further oral feeding attempts until after the contrast enema and potentially the biopsy, correct? Also, while less probable given the complete lack of meconium passage, should we still consider meconium ileus, even though the X-ray didn't show the classic soap bubble appearance? Or perhaps an imperforate anus, although I imagine that would have been visually apparent immediately after birth? I want to make sure we've covered all bases."

Would you recommend any specific views or additions to the contrast enema procedure to better evaluate for meconium ileus, such as delayed films to assess for meconium evacuation? Regarding the less likely differentials, are there any other conditions we should be mindful of, even if remote possibilities, given the patient's presentation?

While the result was normal, the initial concern and testing suggest endocrinology is relevant. * **Elevated glucose:** The elevated glucose levels revealed in the CMP are another key indicator for endocrinological involvement.

While a single elevated random glucose doesn't confirm diabetes, it warrants further investigation with a fasting glucose and HbA1c. Given the known association between PG and diabetes, this is crucial. Secondly, the patient reports ankle swelling. While PG can cause edema in the affected limb, the combination of leg ulcer, ankle swelling, and elevated glucose raises the possibility of venous insufficiency or other circulatory issues contributing to the problem. I'd like your opinion on whether further vascular assessment, like a venous Doppler ultrasound, is warranted. Thirdly, while the patient denies"

However, given the PG diagnosis, I think it's prudent to consider subclinical inflammatory bowel disease. Would you recommend screening with fecal calprotectin or perhaps even a colonoscopy, despite the absence of overt gastrointestinal symptoms? Also, while the biopsy is consistent with PG, are there any other dermatological conditions that we should consider in the differential, even if less likely?

Did the biopsy show any atypical keratinocytes or other features suggestive of SCC that I might have missed? If not, and the tissue culture comes back negative, I'd be inclined to consider SCC very low on the differential.

I'm leaning towards systemic corticosteroids as first-line therapy, given the size and severity of the ulcer. What are your thoughts on the optimal initial dose and route of administration?

The external bleeding does make concealed abruption less likely, but I still think it's worth considering given the severity of the pain and fetal distress. I'm wondering if the initial presentation could have been a mixed picture, with a degree of concealed bleeding initially that then progressed to overt abruption. Regarding the ultrasound, besides placental assessment and looking for signs of rupture, should we also specifically request an assessment of amniotic fluid volume? Oligohydramnios could further complicate the picture and influence management decisions. You mentioned uterine atony earlier. While I agree it's a concern, particularly given the cessation of contractions with the onset of bleeding, wouldn't we expect atony to present with more diffuse, less localized pain than what this patient describes? The sharp, tearing nature of the pain seems more consistent with abruption or rupture. Finally, while extremely rare, are there any other"

The combination of a large ovarian mass, ascites, pleural effusion, and progressive shortness of breath raises a strong suspicion for malignancy, most likely ovarian cancer despite a normal CA-125. The absence of pain is also somewhat atypical, but not unheard of in ovarian cancer. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is ovarian cancer, possibly a low-grade serous or mucinous type given the normal CA-125. However, other possibilities need to be considered. Given the lack of other symptoms and negative review of systems, I'm less suspicious of infectious processes like tuberculosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Heart failure, liver disease, and kidney disease are also lower on my differential given her age, normal blood counts (including hemoglobin), and the absence of other suggestive symptoms.

Meigs syndrome typically presents with a left-sided pleural effusion, although right-sided effusions have been reported. Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few points. Given the patient's young age and the normal CA-125, should we consider a germ cell tumor of the ovary in our differential? These can present with rapid growth and ascites. Also, what are your thoughts on obtaining a preoperative CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis?

These tumor markers can be elevated in certain types of germ cell tumors and could further refine our pre-operative suspicion. Also, while we've discussed ovarian cancer and Meigs syndrome, are there any other less common differentials we should keep in mind, such as a benign cystic teratoma undergoing malignant transformation, or a Krukenberg tumor given the lack of gastrointestinal symptoms? Finally, depending on the findings of the CT scan and the intraoperative assessment, what would be your preferred approach to surgical management \u2013 laparoscopic versus open laparotomy?

Some studies suggest that routine para-aortic lymphadenectomy may not offer a significant survival benefit in early-stage disease, while others advocate for a more comprehensive approach. Also, given the patient's young age and desire for future fertility, if the disease appears to be confined to one ovary, would you consider a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or would you still recommend a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy even in the absence of obvious involvement of the contralateral ovary?
