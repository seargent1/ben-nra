The patient's history of initial improvement followed by worsening discoloration and irritation after continued hydroquinone use further supports this. She's already ceased using the cream about a month ago. My main questions for you are: 1. Given the patient stopped using the hydroquinone a month ago, what treatment approach do you recommend at this stage? Are topical retinoids, chemical peels, or laser therapy appropriate now, or should we wait longer to see if some spontaneous resolution occurs? What are the pros and cons of each approach in this specific case? 2.

The patient didn't report any specific cosmetic use other than the hydroquinone cream, but is there anything specific we should ask her about regarding her cosmetic history or other potential contact allergens that might be relevant to Riehl's? Are there any specific patch tests that would be helpful in this context, even though the biopsy is fairly conclusive for exogenous ochronosis?

I'll also explain the low probability of patch testing to the patient but offer it if she remains concerned about contact allergens. One final question: While we're fairly certain about exogenous ochronosis, the patient initially saw improvement with the hydroquinone. Is it possible that she had a separate pigmentary issue initially, like melasma, that responded to the hydroquinone, and then the exogenous ochronosis developed on top of that, making the overall picture more complex? If so, how might this affect our long-term management strategy, especially if some underlying melasma remains after the exogenous ochronosis resolves or improves? Should we consider revisiting hydroquinone at a much lower concentration and with strict sun protection in the future"

So, assuming the initial presentation was melasma, and now we're dealing with superimposed exogenous ochronosis, it sounds like the long-term strategy involves a multi-phase approach. First, address the ochronosis with watchful waiting, then potentially retinoids, peels, or lasers if needed. Second, once the ochronosis improves, reassess for residual melasma and consider tranexamic acid or azelaic acid. To clarify a few points for my own understanding and for the patient's benefit: 1. Regarding the tranexamic acid, would you recommend oral or topical administration in this scenario? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each route? 2. Similarly, for azelaic acid, what concentration would you recommend starting with, given the patient's history of sensitivity? 3. You mentioned strict sun protection.

One final point I'd like to clarify: Given the potential for a multi-layered pigmentary issue (possible initial melasma now complicated by ochronosis), how should we monitor the patient's progress? Should we schedule follow-up appointments at specific intervals (e.g., every month, every three months) to assess the response to watchful waiting and subsequent treatments?

Regarding the lymph node biopsy, I agree that it shouldn't be delayed significantly if the initial tests don't provide a clear diagnosis. I'm slightly hesitant to jump to a biopsy immediately, as it's an invasive procedure, and the strong epidemiological link to Brazil combined with the eosinophilia makes a parasitic infection quite likely.

Given the atypical presentation with prominent skin involvement and absence of B symptoms, I'm wondering if we should consider other rarer lymphoma subtypes in the differential, even though the biopsy is highly suggestive of IVLBCL. Could the atypical lymphocytes represent a leukemic phase of another lymphoma, or perhaps a blastoid variant? Should we consider flow cytometry on the peripheral blood and/or the bone marrow aspirate to further characterize the immunophenotype and look for circulating lymphoma cells? Also, the patient mentioned being \"a little winded.\" While they attributed this to the fever, with the elevated LDH and the possibility of diffuse disease, I'm wondering about pulmonary involvement.

Besides the blastoid variant, are there any other specific subtypes of aggressive B-cell lymphoma, beyond IVLBCL, that we should be considering based on this presentation? Should we consider primary cutaneous lymphomas, even though the systemic symptoms and high LDH suggest disseminated disease?

She also reports ankle swelling, particularly in the evenings, and some weight gain. The chest x-ray reveals pericardial calcification and pleural effusions. While my initial suspicion was heart failure, the pericardial calcification raises concerns about constrictive pericarditis. The patient denies any history of cardiac infections or known heart conditions, but mentioned working with insulation materials, which I find noteworthy. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is constrictive pericarditis, given the radiological findings and the patient's symptoms. Heart failure remains a possibility, but the pericardial findings make constrictive pericarditis more likely. Other less likely possibilities include malignancy with pericardial involvement or a previous undiagnosed viral pericarditis. I'd like to understand your thoughts on this and"

Are there any specific features we should look for on examination or biopsy that would help distinguish these from a protracted zoster infection? Also, given the patient's age (I should have mentioned she's 68), could this potentially be a zosteriform presentation of another condition, perhaps even a paraneoplastic phenomenon, although she denies any other systemic symptoms?

I have a couple of clarifying questions regarding the antiviral treatment: 1. Given the duration of the rash (four months), is antiviral therapy still likely to be beneficial? I understand it's most effective within 72 hours of onset. Are we hoping to prevent further complications, or is there a chance it could still impact the existing rash and itching? 2.

Did the patient mention any grouping of the \"craters,\" or were they more or less evenly spaced along the dermatome? Also, did the initial description mention any clear fluid within these craters, suggesting vesicles, or were they primarily crusted over at the time of examination? This might help further differentiate between the possible diagnoses. Finally, while we are considering more serious differentials like a paraneoplastic syndrome, are there any other, less serious, inflammatory skin conditions that can sometimes present with a linear or pseudo-dermatomal distribution that we should keep in mind?

I'll inquire about her clothing habits and any new jewelry she might have started wearing around the time of onset. To clarify the morphology further, I'll ask about the grouping and initial presentation of the lesions. Specifically, were they clustered vesicles initially, or did they appear more as individual, scattered lesions that later crusted?

The bronchoalveolar lavage showing 74% eosinophils further solidifies this suspicion. However, I\u2019m puzzled by a few things. Firstly, the patient's blood work, including inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP, came back normal. While this doesn't exclude eosinophilic pneumonia, it's somewhat atypical.

All of these symptoms fall directly under the purview of an ophthalmologist. While the patient's fall could suggest a neurological issue, the lack of other neurological symptoms (dizziness, muscle weakness elsewhere, etc.) and the concurrent eyelid and vision problems make an ophthalmological cause more likely. The ophthalmologist can assess for conditions like ectropion (outward turning eyelid) or entropion (inward turning eyelid), which can cause vision problems and the described sensations. They can also investigate the cause of the haziness and floaters, which could be related to various eye conditions."

My initial differential includes: * **Vitreous changes:** The increased floaters and hazy vision could point to a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) or other vitreous opacities. The lack of flashes and the gradual onset make a retinal tear less likely, but it's still worth considering. * **Early cataracts:** While the normal visual acuity argues against this, some types of cataracts, particularly posterior subcapsular cataracts, can cause hazy vision and increased glare, even with preserved acuity initially. * **Corneal issues:** While less likely"

I'm particularly interested in knowing if there's any optic nerve head swelling or pallor, which could suggest a compressive optic neuropathy if the thyroid eye"

I'll also add slit-lamp examination to the list to assess the cornea and lens in detail, looking for any subtle abnormalities we might have missed. Given the patient's report of increased floaters, a thorough vitreous evaluation during the dilated fundus exam is crucial. While a PVD seems likely, we need to rule out other vitreous opacities or even subtle retinal changes. Regarding thyroid eye disease, even though classic signs like proptosis and lid lag aren't prominent, the lower lid retraction on downgaze and the pulling sensation are suggestive. Besides TSH and free T4, would you also recommend testing for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb)? These could help identify an autoimmune process even if TSH and free T4 are within normal limits. Finally, considering the possibility of optic neuropathy, it"

Before we go to MRI, I'd like to revisit the patient's report of hazy vision. While vitreous changes and early cataracts are still on the differential, the combination of hazy vision, increasing floaters, and now the possibility of thyroid eye disease makes me wonder about other potential inflammatory or autoimmune processes affecting the uvea.

While sarcoidosis is less common, the combination of uveitis, possible restrictive ophthalmopathy, and the unusual lower lid findings makes me want to be thorough. Also, given the patient's age (which I realize wasn't explicitly stated in the initial notes, and I will obtain), could macular degeneration, particularly if there's a significant family history, contribute to the hazy vision and increased floaters?

The patient's description of the sores as painful, however, seems to go against the typical presentation of Granuloma Inguinale. He describes a sharp, burning pain. Are there any variants of Granuloma Inguinale that present with painful lesions? Given that the sores are recurring roughly monthly and resolve without treatment in about two weeks, does that influence your thinking on the most likely diagnosis? Does that periodicity suggest anything in particular? Could this cyclical pattern be related to hormonal fluctuations, or is that unlikely given the infectious nature of the leading differentials? Finally, regarding lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which I mentioned earlier, would you consider that a possibility in this case? What specific features would you look for to differentiate LGV from the other potential"

The recurrence pattern doesn't strongly suggest a specific pathogen, though HSV can recur frequently. Hormonal influence is unlikely. LGV is less likely without lymphadenopathy; look for a small, often painless papule or ulcer that can progress to buboes."

Given the painful nature of the lesions and the absence of lymphadenopathy, those seem less probable. The fact that HSV *can* recur frequently keeps it at the top of the list, especially with the classic initial presentation of the sores. To be thorough, and since the patient is experiencing these outbreaks quite regularly, could we consider obtaining a viral culture during his next outbreak in addition to the PCR swab? While PCR is highly sensitive, a viral culture could provide definitive proof of HSV and also allow for typing and potential antiviral susceptibility testing if needed. Regarding the possibility of a secondary infection contributing to the pain in a less common presentation of Granuloma Inguinale, what specific secondary infections should I be considering? Would a gram stain and culture of the lesion be helpful in identifying a potential secondary bacterial infection? Finally, while the patient"

I'll stick with the plan to obtain a PCR swab from an active lesion during his next outbreak. A gram stain and culture are a good idea as well, to explore the possibility of a secondary bacterial infection contributing to the pain, though the patient hasn't reported any pus or discharge. If the HSV PCR is negative again, I agree that a Dermatology referral would be the next best step. Before we go that route, though, and assuming the second HSV PCR is negative, would you recommend any other specific infectious disease tests to consider, given the chronicity and recurrence? For example, are there any atypical mycobacterial infections that can present with cutaneous lesions resembling HSV? Or any fungal infections that might mimic this presentation? I also want to circle back to the frequency of the outbreaks. While you mentioned that frequent recurrence is possible with HSV, monthly outbreaks seem quite unusual,"

The patient presents with recurring sores on the penis, a classic symptom of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). While initial STI tests were negative, the doctor still suspects herpes simplex virus (HSV) due to the recurring nature, location, and description of the sores, acknowledging the possibility of false negatives. Infectious disease specialists are experts in diagnosing and managing STIs, including complex cases and those with negative initial test results. They are also best equipped to interpret the biopsy results and manage the condition long-term if it is indeed HSV or another less common infection. While a dermatologist *could* potentially also biopsy the lesion, the strong suspicion of an STI makes an infectious disease specialist the most appropriate choice."
