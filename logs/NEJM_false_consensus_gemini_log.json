The biopsy confirms exogenous ochronosis, linked to her prolonged use of a hydroquinone cream purchased online. While the diagnosis seems clear-cut based on the history and biopsy, I have a few thoughts and questions. Firstly, I'm concerned about the source of the \"WhiteGlow\" cream. Given it was purchased from an overseas online pharmacy, we can't be certain of the actual hydroquinone concentration, or if other potentially harmful ingredients were present. This highlights the risks associated with purchasing skincare products from unregulated sources. Secondly, while exogenous ochronosis is the primary diagnosis, I'd like to consider other potential contributing factors or co-existing conditions.

I'll make a note to assess that at the next appointment. Types IV-VI are certainly more susceptible. I also agree that tretinoin and laser therapy are worth considering, but managing patient expectations regarding the variable results is key. I'll research the latest literature on laser modalities for exogenous ochronosis, particularly Q-switched ruby and Nd:YAG lasers. Regarding the initial hyperpigmentation, I'm leaning towards melasma as a possibility, given the location on the face and the patient's mention of it starting subtly and progressing. Did she describe any triggers for the initial darkening, such as pregnancy, hormonal changes, or sun exposure? That information could help differentiate between melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I'll also ask about any history of inflammatory"

Before we finalize the treatment plan, I'd like to clarify a few more things to ensure we're addressing all potential contributing factors. Firstly, while we suspect melasma, could the initial hyperpigmentation have been related to any underlying hormonal imbalances? Should we consider checking her thyroid function or other hormone levels, just to rule out any systemic contributions? Secondly, the patient mentioned occasional ibuprofen use. While it's likely unrelated, could this have contributed to any photosensitivity, exacerbating the hyperpigmentation? I'll review the literature on NSAID-induced photosensitivity.

I'll definitely take a detailed history of her cosmetic use, including specific product names, duration of use, and any observed reactions. Regarding the thyroid function tests, I agree it's a reasonable precaution given the possibility of melasma and its hormonal links. While the ibuprofen-induced photosensitivity is less likely a primary driver, counseling her on sun protection is crucial anyway, given her history and the potential for further complications. Finally, while the biopsy confirms exogenous ochronosis, and the hydroquinone cream is the most likely culprit, could we consider the possibility of a combined effect?

I'll also inquire about any topical steroid use, as combining steroids with hydroquinone can also increase the risk of complications.

We have a patient, recently immigrated from Brazil, presenting with multiple enlarged, tender lymph nodes, primarily cervical and occipital, accompanied by intermittent fever, unintentional weight loss, and peripheral eosinophilia. The symptoms started about three weeks ago and have progressively worsened. The patient reports a dull ache in the affected areas, exacerbated by palpation. They lived near a major city in Brazil but occasionally visited a rural farm. They deny consuming raw or undercooked meat or fish, but I'm still clarifying their potential exposure to untreated water. My primary concern, given the patient's history and clinical presentation, is a parasitic infection, possibly acquired in Brazil. The eosinophilia further supports this suspicion. Differential diagnoses include Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and various helminthic infections. While the patient denies consuming undercooked meat, other routes of transmission exist for these parasites. What are your initial thoughts,"

Perhaps a viral infection that has since resolved, leaving behind the lingering skin changes? EBV or CMV could be considered, though we'd expect to see some evidence in serology.

My initial differential includes: * **Quadriceps tendon rupture:** The \"dip\" above the kneecap and inability to extend the knee strongly suggest this, especially given the initial acute injury.

Based on the description, do you concur with my suspicion of shingles? 2. Are there any other differential diagnoses we should consider at this stage? I'm thinking perhaps a less common presentation of allergic contact dermatitis, or even something like phytophotodermatitis, though the linearity makes that less likely. 3.

I agree that herpes simplex and impetigo are worth considering, though the linear, dermatomal distribution of the rash makes them less probable than zoster. Herpes simplex typically presents with grouped vesicles on an erythematous base, and while it can be painful, the intense pruritus described by the patient is more characteristic of shingles. Impetigo, while often crusted, tends to be more localized and less dermatomal. The spreading nature also argues against impetigo. Regarding the valacyclovir dosage, 1 gram TID for 7 days seems appropriate. I'll certainly monitor for any potential drug interactions with her metformin and watch for any signs of diabetic complications. Do you think we should also consider adding a topical corticosteroid to help manage the itching, or would that be contraindicated given the viral etiology?

The described lesions seem too well-defined for zoster sine herpete. Regarding the PCR testing, if the Tzanck smear is negative, would you recommend direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing as an alternative to PCR? While PCR is generally more sensitive, DFA can sometimes be faster and more readily available in our lab. I'm trying to balance speed, cost, and sensitivity in choosing the best confirmatory test if needed.

This patient presents with a three-month history of productive cough with yellowish-green sputum, night sweats, fevers, chills, and a 20-pound weight loss. The chest x-ray shows upper lobe-predominant peripheral and subpleural consolidations, sparing the perihilar region. This pattern, combined with the clinical picture, raises strong suspicion for tuberculosis, even though the patient denies known TB contacts. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is pulmonary tuberculosis. The chronicity of symptoms, constitutional symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, fevers), and the x-ray findings are highly suggestive. However, given the lack of confirmed TB exposure and the somewhat atypical distribution on the x-ray (peripheral and subpleural rather than apical), we need to consider other possibilities. Other infectious etiologies to consider include fungal infections like histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, especially if the patient"

Would you also recommend testing for other mycobacteria, like *M. kansasii*? Given the patient's significant weight loss and the chronicity of the illness, I'm also wondering about the possibility of an underlying immunodeficiency. While the patient denies any known history of immune issues, could this presentation be suggestive of HIV, even in the absence of specific risk factors?

Regarding malignancy, would you recommend pursuing any specific tumor markers at this stage, or should we hold off until after the initial infectious workup?

I'm thinking a thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) test might be informative, even if they don't necessarily change our immediate management. Also, given the patient's age and the presence of TED, which can sometimes be difficult to manage, should we consider involving a specialist in oculoplastics or orbital surgery early on, even before the ophthalmology evaluation is complete? I'm wondering if having that specialist on board from the beginning might be beneficial in case more aggressive"

I don't think further speciation is necessary at this point. My main concern is ensuring proper management to prevent recurrence. He uses a spacer, which is good, but his inconsistent rinsing after inhaler use is definitely contributing. Do you have any recommendations beyond emphasizing meticulous oral hygiene after each use? Would you consider recommending a switch to a different inhaler delivery system, like a dry powder inhaler, to minimize the risk of further fungal growth? Also, what's your preferred first-line antifungal treatment for this presentation? I was considering oral fluconazole, but I'm open to suggestions."

Beh\u00e7et's is a systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) that falls under the purview of rheumatology. While dermatologists can sometimes manage skin manifestations of Beh\u00e7et's, a rheumatologist is crucial for diagnosing and managing the systemic aspects of the disease, which can affect multiple organs. The patient's recurring genital ulcers, combined with the mention of canker sores (another common symptom of Beh\u00e7et's), strongly suggests this condition as a possibility. A rheumatologist can order further testing to confirm or rule out Beh\u00e7et's and initiate appropriate treatment if necessary."
