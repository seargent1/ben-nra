I haven't yet ordered serologic testing for AChR antibodies or performed electrodiagnostic studies including repetitive nerve stimulation. Those are the next steps I intended to take to confirm the diagnosis. Before considering a trial of pyridostigmine, I wanted to discuss a few other points. While the fluctuating nature of the symptoms and the prominent ocular involvement strongly suggest MG, the predominantly proximal weakness, particularly in the upper limbs, is somewhat atypical. While MG *can* present with proximal weakness, it more commonly affects the ocular, bulbar, and neck muscles first. I was also wondering about the lack of other bulbar symptoms, such as dysarthria or dysphagia. Given the proximal predominance, I was also considering other conditions like Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS),"

I agree that LEMS is less probable given the absence of autonomic dysfunction, which I should have explicitly asked about. No dry mouth, constipation, or orthostatic hypotension were reported, correct? While the proximal weakness is atypical, the fatigability and ocular symptoms point strongly towards MG. Would you consider a single-fiber EMG in this case, given the atypical presentation? It could be helpful in confirming the diagnosis if the antibody tests are negative. Also, given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms over just a month, should we be considering other diagnoses, even if less likely? I'm thinking specifically about inflammatory myopathies, although the lack of pain and normal CK levels (assuming they are \u2013 I haven't seen those results yet) make it less probable.

Given that we\u2019re leaning towards MG, and considering the atypical presentation with proximal weakness, I\u2019m curious about your thoughts on the possibility of a thymoma. While the chest CT will help visualize any thymic abnormalities, would you recommend ordering any additional tests related to thymic function, or would you wait for the CT results first? Also, while we\u2019ve discussed LEMS and ruled it less likely due to the absence of autonomic symptoms, I\u2019d like to revisit the possibility, however remote, of other neuromuscular junction disorders, such as congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS).

Just to clarify, given the atypical presentation with predominantly proximal weakness, if the AChR and MuSK antibodies return negative, would you still recommend pursuing a single-fiber EMG before considering other diagnoses, or would you broaden the differential at that point? I'm thinking about conditions like mitochondrial myopathies, although the lack of other multi-system involvement makes that less likely. Also, should we consider a thyroid panel, even though the patient denies any history of thyroid problems? Sometimes subtle thyroid dysfunction can mimic neuromuscular disorders.

My primary concern is confirming the PML diagnosis and initiating appropriate management.

What are your thoughts on managing the Crohn's disease while we address the PML? Are there specific immunosuppressants we should avoid given the PML diagnosis, or are there safer alternatives we can consider to control the Crohn's while the patient's immune system recovers? While the MRI findings are highly suggestive of PML, are there any other differential diagnoses we should consider, even if less likely, given the patient's presentation and natalizumab use?

What parameters would you suggest we monitor to guide that decision (e.g., lesion size on repeat MRI, clinical worsening, specific inflammatory markers)? Also, while the JC virus PCR in the CSF has high sensitivity and specificity for PML, false negatives can occur, especially early in the disease course. If the PCR is negative, but the clinical picture and MRI findings remain highly suspicious for PML, what would be our next step?

I'm slightly concerned about the timeframe of 3-4 days. While intussusception can present acutely, this duration seems a bit longer than typical. Have you seen cases present this way? I'm also wondering about other less common causes of obstruction, such as a congenital band or internal hernia, though I haven't elicited any history suggestive of prior abdominal surgery.

Could Hirschsprung's disease, even though the family history is negative, still be a possibility, or is that effectively ruled out by the child's age and the fact he's been passing stool normally up until a few days ago?

Given the slightly longer timeframe of symptoms, is there any scenario where you might consider a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis *before* the upper GI series, particularly if the air contrast enema is unsuccessful?

If the biopsy does come back as NLPHL, would you recommend any specific further investigations beyond the standard staging workup for lymphoma? Also, regarding the MYC marker in DLBCL, if it comes back positive, should we automatically consider this a \"double-hit\" or \"triple-hit\" lymphoma, or are there other factors that need to be considered?

However, the lack of other findings makes them more plausible. She hasn't tried NSAIDs yet. I was hesitant to recommend them before getting your input, wanting to ensure we weren't masking any significant underlying pathology. Given her age and the mechanism of injury, I'm still leaning towards a meniscal or ligamentous injury, albeit a mild one. The absence of swelling and instability could simply mean a minor sprain or a small tear in a non-weight-bearing portion of the meniscus. Would you recommend an MRI now, or would you suggest a trial of NSAIDs and activity modification for a week or two before considering imaging?"

Given her negative ligamentous instability tests and the localized tenderness, I'm now leaning slightly more towards pes anserine bursitis or medial plica syndrome as you suggested. The mechanism of injury with repetitive jumping and pivoting could certainly irritate those structures. Before we conclude, I wanted to clarify something.

At the two-week follow-up, if she has complete resolution of symptoms, we'll likely forgo further imaging and encourage a gradual return to activity. If she has partial improvement, we'll refer her to physical therapy. If PT fails and we suspect pes anserine bursitis based on her symptoms and exam findings, we can then consider a corticosteroid injection.

This seems to isolate the event to the act of micturition. Given the normal initial workup, including the ECG, and the absence of classic prodromal symptoms, I'm leaning towards a neurally mediated reflex syncope, possibly related to situational factors like micturition syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity.

I'll examine the patient for coloboma, cranial nerve abnormalities, and genital abnormalities to assess for CHARGE syndrome, as you suggested. Just a couple more questions: 1. While we await the TORCH panel results, are there any other specific laboratory tests you would recommend at this stage, such as genetic testing or specific metabolic panels, that might shed light on the overall clinical picture? 2. Assuming the cataracts are consistent with congenital rubella and the TORCH panel confirms the diagnosis, what are the long-term visual"

I'm more concerned about the possibility of a malignant phyllodes tumor itself, given the rapid growth. What are your thoughts on ordering an MRI? Could it provide additional information beyond the ultrasound and help with surgical planning, especially if there's a suspicion of malignancy and potential need for wider excision?

Are there any specific immunohistochemical stains you would recommend for the core biopsy that might help differentiate between a malignant phyllodes tumor and a metaplastic carcinoma, or any other less common but aggressive breast malignancies?

While the rapid growth is concerning, the absence of necrosis on the initial imaging and the classic phyllodes presentation on the initial biopsy still make me lean towards that diagnosis. However, to be absolutely thorough, are there any other rare breast malignancies, besides metaplastic carcinoma, that we should consider in the differential, given this presentation of rapid growth and the leaf-like appearance on biopsy?

My primary differential diagnosis is postpartum endometritis. Given the recent vaginal delivery, prolonged labor, and large infant size, she has multiple risk factors. The heavy, foul-smelling lochia, fever, and uterine tenderness further support this diagnosis. Other possibilities, though less likely given the current information, include retained placental fragments, a pelvic abscess, or a urinary tract infection"

However, the patient denies significant pain during bowel movements, which argues against an anal fissure. The prolapsing mass was easily reducible, making complete rectal prolapse less likely, though I suppose a small internal prolapse could be contributing. Angiodysplasia is a possibility, but typically presents with more maroon-colored blood, whereas this patient describes bright red blood. Given the patient's age (not explicitly stated, but implied to be younger given the lack of mentioned comorbidities and normal vitals), angiodysplasia seems less probable. Could you elaborate on why you included angiodysplasia in the differential, given the bright red blood? Are there any other less common diagnoses we should be considering, such as solitary rectal ulcer syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, even though the presentation isn't classic for either?

While the patient denies significant pain, they do report mild post-BM itching. Could this itching, in conjunction with the bleeding and prolapsing mass, suggest a thrombosed external hemorrhoid that has resolved, leaving behind some residual irritation? Or is the itching more likely related to the internal hemorrhoids themselves? 2. Regarding the colonoscopy, should we specifically request biopsies from the rectum even if the mucosa appears normal, given the bleeding and to definitively exclude proctitis or other localized inflammatory processes? Or would you prefer to take biopsies only if visual abnormalities are present? 3"

Now, regarding the rehab protocol, while I agree with early ROM and progressive weight-bearing, I'm a bit concerned about starting weight-bearing as early as week 6, especially given the potential for labral or ligamentum teres tears, which we'll assess with the pre-reduction MRI. Wouldn't a more conservative approach, perhaps delaying full weight-bearing until 8-12 weeks, be warranted to protect the healing soft tissues and minimize the risk of avascular necrosis, particularly if the MRI reveals significant damage?

Regarding the MRI, should we also obtain dedicated sequences for the cartilage to assess for any chondral lesions or osteochondral defects? While the mechanism of injury is more suggestive of labral and ligamentum teres pathology, I'd like to ensure we're not missing any associated cartilage damage that could impact long-term outcomes. 2. You mentioned progressive weight-bearing. Could you elaborate on your typical progression?

The patient experienced a jamming injury to his right ring finger during a football game, resulting in pain, swelling, and an inability to extend the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. The X-ray ruled out a fracture, and the patient reports no numbness or tingling. He describes the pain as sharp, localized to the DIP joint, and worsened by movement. The mechanism of injury, the drooping of the fingertip, and the absence of a popping or tearing sensation (which might suggest a tendon avulsion) all point towards a closed mallet finger injury. However, before we definitively conclude, I'd like to clarify a few points. Could you confirm if the patient was able to actively extend the DIP joint immediately after the injury, even if painful? This helps differentiate between a partial and complete tendon laceration. Also, did the physical exam reveal any skin lacerations or"

Regarding your question about volar plate injury, there was tenderness on palpation of the DIP joint, but I didn't appreciate any significant laxity. However, given the swelling, it was a bit difficult to assess fully. Should we consider an ultrasound to better evaluate the integrity of the volar plate and definitively rule out a concomitant injury? While a simple mallet finger is the most likely diagnosis, I want to ensure we haven't missed a subtle volar plate avulsion or other associated ligamentous injury, which could influence management. Additionally, could you weigh in on the best splinting strategy? I was planning on a continuous stack splint for 6-8 weeks, but I'm open to other options."

In your experience, does the absence of this finding reliably rule out a tendon avulsion, or could it still be a possibility even without that specific symptom? I'm wondering if the mechanism of injury (a jamming force) makes an avulsion less likely compared to a forceful hyperextension injury. Also, assuming the ultrasound confirms a simple mallet finger without volar plate involvement, what are your thoughts on early controlled mobilization protocols after a few weeks of splinting? Some studies suggest that early mobilization might improve long-term DIP joint function. I'm curious to hear your perspective on the risks and benefits in this particular case.

Also, while we await the *C. difficile* toxin results, what are your thoughts on empiric treatment for *C. difficile*? The patient is experiencing significant discomfort, and while loperamide helps with the cramping, it doesn't address the underlying cause if it is indeed *C. difficile*.

Should we consider this in our differential, and if so, are there any specific investigations we should pursue at this stage, or should we manage the symptoms and re-evaluate if the diarrhea persists beyond a few weeks?

The patient reports constant burning pain, worsened when the leg is dependent, and throbbing pain, especially at night.

This will help determine if the abruption contributed to the rupture or vice-versa. 2. **What is the patient's current hemodynamic status?** Specifically, what are her blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation? This information, combined with the estimated blood loss from the ultrasound, will help guide the urgency and aggressiveness of resuscitation. 3. **Has the massive transfusion protocol been activated?** And if"

Before we conclude, I have a couple of final clarifying questions.

If the PCR comes back negative for CMV, what would be your next diagnostic considerations, given the patient's presentation and the fundoscopic findings?

To clarify regarding the alternative diagnoses, are there any specific fundoscopic features we should be looking for that might point towards one of those over the others?

This rules out several common culprits like infections, obvious inflammatory bowel disease, and microscopic colitis. The slightly elevated white blood cell count is nonspecific and could be related to any number of minor processes. My primary concern, given the chronicity, mucus, and incomplete evacuation sensation, is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), specifically IBS-M (mixed). However, the lack of a clear relationship between symptoms and food intake is somewhat atypical. Also, while the patient denies a family history of IBD, the negative calprotectin doesn't entirely exclude it, especially considering the mucus. Functional diarrhea is also a possibility.

To answer your question, the patient hasn't tried any anti-diarrheal medications yet. I was hesitant to prescribe them before having a clearer picture of the underlying cause. Before we proceed to a colonoscopy, I'd like to explore a few more points. First, while the stool studies were negative, the patient mentioned a camping trip a few months prior to the onset of symptoms. Did they mention any details about their water source during the trip? Giardia can sometimes be missed on routine stool testing, and the chronicity and mucus are consistent with giardiasis. I think it's worth considering a Giardia-specific antigen test or even an empiric trial of metronidazole. Second, the patient reported a somewhat atypical diet for breakfast \u2013 toast and"

While Giardia is a strong suspect given the camping trip, the normal fecal calprotectin makes me wonder if we should also consider other parasitic infections, like Cryptosporidium, which can also cause chronic diarrhea. Would you recommend adding a Cryptosporidium antigen test to the Giardia testing, or would you prefer to see how the Giardia test results look first?

I'm wondering if we should consider bile acid malabsorption (BAM) as another possibility. The chronic diarrhea, especially with a normal calprotectin, fits the profile, and it can sometimes coexist with IBS. Would you recommend a trial of a bile acid sequestrant like cholestyramine before moving to a colonoscopy, or would you prefer to reserve that for post-colonoscopy if the findings are unremarkable?

The shortness of breath is exertional and orthopnea is present. She reports abdominal tightness but no distinct pain. The abdominal distension is constant, and she denies any changes in bowel or urinary habits, nausea, or vomiting. While she hasn't measured it, she reports a subjective increase in abdominal girth. Importantly, she has a right-sided pleural effusion and significant ascites on imaging, along with a large right ovarian mass confirmed on ultrasound. Her CA-125 is normal, which is somewhat unexpected. She has a family history of breast cancer in her mother, but no known genetic testing was performed at that time. No prior abdominal surgeries. My primary concern is a malignant ovarian process, possibly a borderline or low-grade ovarian tumor given the normal CA-125."

Given the ascites and pleural effusion, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of a low-grade serous carcinoma or possibly a borderline serous tumor. However, the relatively rapid onset of symptoms and the presence of the pleural effusion, even with a normal CA-125, makes me wonder about other possibilities. Could this be a primary peritoneal carcinoma mimicking an ovarian primary? Also, given her mother's history of breast cancer, although distant, should we consider the possibility of a metastatic process, perhaps from an occult breast primary in the patient? I'd like to see if the gynecologic oncologist can obtain a cytology of the ascitic fluid and pleural fluid for analysis. This could help differentiate between a primary ovarian process and a metastatic one. What are your thoughts on these additional considerations? Would you recommend any further imaging, such as a mammogram or breast MRI,"

Regarding the CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, would you recommend obtaining that prior to the Gyn Onc consult, or should we wait for their input on the timing of that scan? I'm wondering if having the CT results beforehand might expedite their initial assessment. Also, given the patient's relatively young age and the possibility of a BRCA mutation, even though her mother didn't undergo testing, should we consider genetic testing for the patient at this point? It could influence surgical decision-making if a BRCA mutation is found. Finally, while less likely given the presentation, should we consider other, rarer ovarian tumor types"

Could you elaborate on which specific subtypes within those categories we should be mindful of, given her presentation? Are there any specific tumor markers that might be helpful in differentiating these less common subtypes, beyond the CEA and CA 15-3 we've already discussed? Also, given the rapid accumulation of ascites and the pleural effusion, I'm wondering about the patient's overall functional status and nutritional status. Should we consider a referral to palliative care, not necessarily for end-of-life care, but for symptom management and support, particularly regarding the shortness of breath and potential impact on her quality of life while we await the Gyn Onc consultation and definitive diagnosis?"

A nutritional consult is also a good point, especially considering the potential for malnutrition and further ascites development. I'll arrange for that as well. Before we conclude, I have a few final clarifying questions. Given the patient's young age and the possibility of a germ cell tumor, should we consider adding a beta-hCG to the tumor marker panel, even though her presentation isn't overtly suggestive of a choriocarcinoma or other gestational trophoblastic disease? Also, regarding the granulosa cell tumor possibility, while inhibin is a helpful marker, are there any imaging characteristics on the ultrasound or forthcoming CT scan that might suggest this diagnosis, such as specific features of the mass itself or its vascularity?"
