I'm strongly suspecting myasthenia gravis (MG) given the constellation of symptoms: progressive proximal muscle weakness worse with exertion and improving with rest, diplopia, ptosis, and the positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The patient also reports difficulty keeping their head up, which suggests neck muscle involvement. The reported dyspnea on exertion raises a red flag and needs further investigation. My main questions for you are: 1. Do you agree with the likely diagnosis of MG? 2. What further investigations, if any, do you recommend to confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity, particularly regarding respiratory function? I'm thinking pulmonary function tests (PFTs), specifically forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF), to assess the potential for a myasthenic crisis. Perhaps also a single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) if the diagnosis remains uncertain. 3. Given the potential"

I agree that starting pyridostigmine while we wait for the PFTs is a good idea, both therapeutically and diagnostically. I have a couple of further thoughts: 1. Given the patient's dyspnea on exertion, even though it hasn't progressed to nocturnal symptoms, I'm still concerned about the potential for respiratory compromise. Should we consider a baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) along with the PFTs to get a clearer picture of their respiratory status? I'm wondering if we should also discuss the possibility of a short course of corticosteroids if the PFTs show any significant impairment, even in the absence of a full-blown crisis. 2.

I'll also discuss the potential benefits and side effects of corticosteroids with the patient, should the PFTs warrant their use. We've already confirmed positive AChR antibodies in this case, so MuSK antibodies testing isn't immediately necessary. However, given the patient's report of dyspnea on exertion, even though it's not at rest or nocturnal, I'm wondering if we should consider a more proactive approach to respiratory monitoring. Would you recommend a baseline overnight oximetry study in addition to the PFTs and ABGs? This might help us identify any subtle nocturnal desaturations that could be easily missed. Also, while we're discussing respiratory management, what's your threshold for considering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis in a patient with MG who presents with dyspnea on exertion but without overt respiratory failure?"

While the patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of MG, and the AChR antibodies are positive, are there any other mimickers we should consider in the differential diagnosis, even if less likely? I'm thinking specifically about Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), given the proximal muscle weakness. Although the patient doesn't describe autonomic symptoms, and the diplopia is more typical of MG, I want to ensure we've considered all possibilities.

Botulism and mitochondrial myopathies seem less probable given the clinical picture and time course, but it's prudent to keep them in mind. Regarding botulism, has the patient reported any recent unusual dietary intake, particularly canned foods? I'll also add a question about any family history of mitochondrial disorders, although the relatively acute onset makes this less likely. Given that we're broadening the differential slightly, I'd like to revisit the patient's dyspnea on exertion. While we've agreed that IVIG/PLEX are not currently indicated, and we're pursuing PFTs, ABGs, and overnight oximetry, I'm still slightly apprehensive.

Also, while the MRI findings are highly suggestive, and we're pursuing JCV DNA PCR, are there any other CSF studies we should consider alongside the PCR, such as looking for other opportunistic infections or inflammatory markers?

He cries, particularly when his abdomen is palpated, and draws his legs up. He hasn't been vomiting, and while the mother reports he seems heavier, we don't have specific weight changes. The abdominal X-ray shows dilated bowel segments and an absence of gas in the rectum, highly suggestive of an obstruction. The CBC was normal. My primary concern is intussusception given the age and presentation. While we haven't seen currant jelly stools, the absence doesn't rule it out. I've tried to ascertain whether the pain is intermittent and if he gets relief after passing gas, which could point towards"

I'm a little hesitant to completely discount Hirschsprung's, even though it typically presents earlier. Could the partial obstruction explain the later presentation and the fact that *some* gas is passing? Is it worth considering a rectal biopsy if the enema doesn't resolve the obstruction, or should we go straight to exploratory laparotomy if that's the case?

For instance, could the ultrasound help differentiate between intussusception and malrotation, or would the contrast enema be more definitive in that regard?

Should we be considering other, more aggressive subtypes that can present with localized disease and splenomegaly, even with a negative PET scan? For example, could this be a localized presentation of a higher-grade B-cell lymphoma with unusual initial staging? 2. The patient experiences a sharpening of abdominal pain after eating. While this could be related to splenomegaly, it also raises the question of"

The mechanism of injury (jumping and twisting during volleyball), the location of pain (medial joint line, inferior to the patella), the worsening pain with weight-bearing and extension, and the relief with slight flexion all point towards this. The reported stiffness and throbbing are also consistent with meniscal pathology. While I've requested an MRI to confirm, I'd like to discuss a few other possibilities. Given the patient's recent increase in training intensity, we should consider medial patellofemoral pain syndrome (MPFPS) or a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain. Although the mechanism of injury is less typical for an MCL sprain in isolation, it's possible. Did you notice anything in the notes to suggest valgus stress during the injury?

The patient also described the pain as sometimes radiating up the thigh, which is more common with meniscal tears than pes anserine bursitis, in my experience. Did you have any other concerns based on the history? Also, given the patient's age (I should have mentioned she's 22), do you think a spontaneous osteochondral lesion is a possibility, even without a specific traumatic event described?

Also, while the MRI is pending, should we consider a referral to physical therapy for a formal evaluation and guidance on the exercises, or is a home program sufficient for now?

One final question \u2013 given the patient's age and athletic involvement, if the MRI does confirm a meniscus tear, what would your general approach be in terms of surgical versus non-surgical management? Would you lean towards a repair if possible, given her age and activity level, or are there specific factors you'd be looking for on the MRI to guide that decision (e.g., location of the tear, type of tear)? Also, if it is a tear, would you typically aspirate the knee at the time of the initial evaluation or wait until potentially during a surgical procedure?"

These could be attributed to the PDA, but given the overall picture of CRS, it's likely multifactorial. I agree that an EKG is warranted to rule out other cardiac anomalies, and I'll order that now. Are there any other specific cardiac issues you'd recommend looking for in the context of CRS, besides the PDA? While pulmonary artery stenosis is less common, should we be actively evaluating for that as well?

Regarding the PDA management, I agree with the 24-48 hour monitoring period in the NICU. My main concern with medical closure is the potential for renal impairment with NSAIDs, especially given her lack of urine output so far. Could we consider a prostaglandin inhibitor like alprostadil as an alternative if medical closure becomes necessary? It might be a gentler option for her kidneys.

The lack of bowel movements and increased discomfort with abdominal pressure also raises the possibility of constipation contributing to her discomfort, but I believe the infection should be our primary concern. My initial differential diagnosis includes: * **Endometritis:** This is highest on my list given the fever, lower abdominal tenderness, and recent vaginal delivery. While she doesn't report foul-smelling lochia, the localized tenderness and other symptoms warrant further investigation. * **Constipation:** The lack of bowel movements and increased abdominal discomfort with pressure certainly suggest this. It could be exacerbating her pain, but I don't think it explains the fever. * **"

Given the initial report of a mass (even though she couldn't palpate it herself) and the family history of unspecified GI diseases, I'm wondering if we should still consider other possibilities, even if less likely.

If the family history involves colorectal cancer or polyps, I agree a full colonoscopy would be the most prudent course. Even if the flexible sigmoidoscopy is normal, a full colonoscopy would offer complete peace of mind and allow us to evaluate the entire colon.

She's already experiencing itching, and while we can address that symptomatically, I'd like to discuss preventative measures and potential interventions if they become more problematic. Are there specific lifestyle modifications or dietary recommendations you typically suggest beyond increased fiber intake? What's your threshold for recommending banding or other procedures?

I agree that it would be helpful to see if it elicits more epileptiform activity, especially given the reported nocturnal event. An MRI is also a good idea to rule out any structural lesions, like a focal cortical dysplasia or low-grade tumor, that could be contributing to the seizures. Given the patient's age, I'm also wondering about benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE). While the semiology doesn't perfectly fit, the age and the prominent facial involvement make me want to consider it. Do you think the EEG findings could be consistent with BRE, even though the focus appears to be temporal? Could the temporal spikes be secondary to a rolandic focus? Also, while the patient denies limb movements during awake episodes, the description of feeling \"spaced out\" before the events makes me wonder if subtle automatisms might be present"

For example, are there specific types of automatisms or other ictal behaviors that are more characteristic of one over the other? Also, considering the patient's age and the possibility of a structural abnormality, are there any specific MRI protocols or sequences that you would recommend to maximize the chances of detecting subtle lesions? Should we consider a higher field strength MRI, or specific sequences like FLAIR or DWI?

Regarding the early mobilization with PT, what specific exercises or movements do you typically recommend in the initial phase, and are there any movements that should be strictly avoided to prevent re-dislocation, particularly given this is a posterior dislocation? Do you have a preference for continuous passive motion (CPM) machines in these cases? Finally, while 6-8 weeks is a reasonable timeframe for protected weight-bearing, what specific clinical and radiological criteria do you use to determine readiness for full weight-bearing?

Regarding the possibility of malrotation, if the abdominal x-ray shows the classic \"double-bubble\" sign, would you recommend proceeding directly to an upper GI series to confirm, or would the contrast enema still be the next step? I'm wondering if a \"double-bubble\" would be enough to prioritize the upper GI given the potential urgency of a volvulus.

Just to clarify one final point regarding the referral to hand surgery at the 6-week mark: Should the referral be made regardless of the degree of extension lag, or is there a specific threshold (e.g., 10 degrees, 20 degrees) that would trigger the referral? I want to ensure we're not referring patients unnecessarily if there's only a minimal lag that might resolve with continued conservative management, such as hand therapy.

The location of the swelling at the base of the skull, while possibly a cyst as indicated by the ultrasound, could also be related to thyroid or parathyroid glands, which are under the purview of an endocrinologist. The doctor may be considering conditions like a thyroid nodule or other endocrine-related masses in that area.

The patient has well-controlled type 2 diabetes, but could this mass be related to any diabetic complications, perhaps some sort of unusual inflammatory process or even amyloidosis, although that's typically associated with longer-standing, less well-controlled diabetes? Also, the patient is on naproxen. Could this be playing a role, perhaps an unusual drug reaction manifesting as a localized inflammatory response mimicking a cyst?

The patient presents with a painful, ulcerative lesion on the anterior right leg, characterized by a necrotic base and purplish, irregular borders. The burning pain, particularly at night, coupled with the yellowish discharge, initially suggested a venous ulcer or possibly even an infection. However, the biopsy showing neutrophilic infiltration without infection, along with the patient's confirmed history of Crohn's disease, strongly points towards pyoderma gangrenosum. The elevated blood glucose also aligns with their reported type 2 diabetes. The presence of pitting edema and dilated tortuous veins in the lower legs suggests venous insufficiency, which could be a contributing factor, but the lesion's characteristics are not typical of a simple venous ulcer.

What initial dosage would you recommend given the 4cm lesion size and the patient's other comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension)? 2. **Topical treatment as an adjunct:** While I think systemic treatment is warranted here, would you recommend adding a topical corticosteroid as well?

Would you consider starting at 0.5mg/kg/day and titrating up if needed, to minimize the impact on blood glucose control? We'll obviously monitor their blood glucose levels closely. 2. **Regarding clobetasol:** While I agree with its efficacy, I'm concerned about the potential for skin atrophy, especially with prolonged use. Do you have a preferred duration for the topical clobetasol, or would you recommend tapering it down to a less potent topical steroid once we see improvement in the lesion? 3. **Regarding pain management:** Topical lidocaine is a good option.

Just a few more points for clarification: 1. **Monitoring:** Besides blood glucose, what other parameters should we monitor closely while the patient is on systemic corticosteroids? I'm thinking specifically about electrolytes, blood pressure, and any signs of infection. 2. **Duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy:** Do you have a general timeframe in mind for how long the patient might need to be on prednisone? I understand it will depend on their response, but a ballpark estimate would be helpful.

Her hemoglobin is slightly low at 10.2 g/dL, platelets are within normal range, and coagulation studies (PT/aPTT) are also normal. She denies any recent trauma, intercourse, or vaginal exams. This is her second pregnancy, and she denies any complications with this or her previous pregnancy. She denies taking any medications, including blood thinners or NSAIDs.

She didn't specifically mention uterine hypertonus or constant contractions, but the severe, sharp abdominal pain she described could certainly be consistent with either. I wish I had asked more directly about the nature of the pain \u2013 whether it was constant or intermittent, wave-like or persistent. Do we have any information on her previous delivery?

Visualizing the placenta and assessing fetal well-being would be invaluable at this point. I'm particularly concerned about the cessation of fetal movement she reported. While we wait for the hospital's update, I'm still leaning towards placental abruption given the classic presentation.

This young, sexually active male presents with a migratory oligoarthritis affecting first his left ankle, then his right knee, accompanied by urethritis and conjunctivitis. The synovial fluid analysis from the knee shows an inflammatory picture consistent with arthritis. While his HLA-B27 and CRP are negative, and the Chlamydia/Gonorrhea tests are also negative, the overall clinical picture strongly suggests reactive arthritis, possibly triggered by a non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial infection. The fact that the ankle symptoms preceded the urethritis is somewhat atypical for classic reactive arthritis, but doesn't exclude it. My primary concern is reactive arthritis, but given the family history of rheumatoid arthritis, I'd like your opinion on whether that's a possibility we should still consider.

Regarding psoriatic arthritis, has the patient reported any skin changes like nail pitting, onycholysis, or psoriasis plaques?

Should we consider those tests only if the initial workup for reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Lyme disease comes back negative?

The ultrasound reveals a large ovarian mass and ascites (fluid in the abdomen). These findings, combined with the patient's symptoms, raise a strong suspicion for ovarian cancer. Gynecologic oncologists are specialists in diagnosing and treating cancers of the female reproductive system, including ovarian cancer. While the CA-125 is normal, it is not definitive, and further investigation by a specialist is warranted. A gynecologic oncologist is best equipped to perform the necessary diagnostic procedures, such as a biopsy, and to develop an appropriate treatment plan if cancer is confirmed."
