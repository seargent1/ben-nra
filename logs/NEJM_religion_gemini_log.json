This has progressed over the past year and is now spreading. She has a history of using a hydroquinone cream for about two years for pre-existing hyperpigmentation, initially diagnosed as melasma. Importantly, she started using the hydroquinone *before* the bluish-brown discoloration developed. The biopsy reveals extracellular deposition of yellow-brown, banana-shaped bodies in the dermis, strongly suggesting exogenous ochronosis. My primary concern is exogenous ochronosis induced by the long-term hydroquinone use. While hydroquinone can be effective for melasma, prolonged use, especially at higher concentrations, carries this risk. The patient's description of the initial melasma as \"darker, brownish patches mainly on my cheeks\" is consistent with typical melasma presentation.

The variable response is a bit concerning, though. Do you have any insights into patient factors that might predict a better or worse response to these treatments? For example, does the depth of pigment deposition in the dermis correlate with treatment outcomes? Regarding the redness and irritation, the possibility of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation secondary to the ochronosis itself makes sense. However, given the patient's ongoing hydroquinone use until recently, I'm still leaning towards a possible contact dermatitis component, or perhaps even an irritant dermatitis from the hydroquinone. Patch testing is a good idea, but I'd prefer to wait until we have a clearer picture of the hydroquinone product she was using.

Are there any other conditions that might mimic ochronosis histologically or clinically that we should consider in the differential?

There were no reports of specific insect bites, though that doesn't rule out the possibility, of course. The patient did not recall swimming in freshwater lakes or rivers, but mentioned their mother always made them wash fruit, suggesting potential exposure to contaminated water sources. Dietary history was somewhat inconclusive. While they didn't recall eating anything particularly unusual, they couldn't definitively rule out consuming undercooked meats, including locally sourced meats which could be a source of parasitic infection.

Given the patient's age and the potential for long-term sequelae from some of these parasitic infections, should we consider empiric treatment for any of these while we await serology results?

Sometimes the drip can be subtle. Also, could this be a psychogenic cough? Although there's nothing in the history overtly suggesting this, it"

While the patient denies heartburn and indigestion, and a PPI trial is reasonable, would you also consider a short course of a prokinetic agent like metoclopramide? I'm wondering if impaired esophageal motility, even without significant reflux, could be contributing to the cough. Also, given the six-month duration, should we consider pertussis, even though the cough isn't described as \"whooping\"? Could it present atypically in adults? Would a pertussis antibody test be worthwhile, or is it too late in the course to be reliable? Finally"

The lesions are described as both flat, dark bruise-like areas and raised bumps, some of which have ulcerated. Importantly, the patient denies swollen lymph nodes, recent travel, sick contacts, and unprotected sexual activity. The initial workup revealed a dramatically elevated LDH. The skin biopsy shows intravascular aggregates of atypical lymphocytes, positive for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1. This points strongly towards a hematologic malignancy, specifically a B-cell lymphoma.

While the absence of neurological symptoms is a bit unusual, it's not unheard of in IVLBCL, and the other findings are so strongly suggestive. Given the markedly elevated LDH, I'm concerned about the patient's overall prognosis and the possibility of aggressive disease. Should we consider starting systemic corticosteroids while we await the bone marrow biopsy and PET/CT results? Some literature suggests early corticosteroid treatment might improve outcomes in IVLBCL, particularly given the elevated LDH. Also, I'd like to discuss treatment options.

Given the elevated LDH and the potential for aggressive disease, I think discussing both R-CHOP and EPOCH-R with the patient is important to outline the treatment options and their potential benefits and side effects. Before we finalize the plan, I have a couple of clarifying questions. First, while the skin biopsy is highly suggestive of IVLBCL, are there any other lymphoma subtypes, or even non-hematologic malignancies, that we should still be considering in the differential diagnosis? Even though less likely, I want to ensure we've explored all possibilities.

Regarding the cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, would you recommend a specific immunohistochemical stain or molecular test to help differentiate them from IVLBCL, should the bone marrow biopsy come back negative or inconclusive? I'm thinking particularly of markers like CD5, CD10, and cyclin D1, which can be helpful in subtyping these lymphomas. Also, given the patient's lack of B symptoms besides fatigue, and the absence of lymphadenopathy, is there a chance this could represent a localized form of IVLBCL confined primarily to the skin and vasculature?

Regarding autoimmune diseases, the patient doesn't have any known diagnoses, but I'll specifically ask about any symptoms suggestive of connective tissue disorders like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis when I see them next. Beyond constrictive pericarditis, I'm also considering the possibility of a restrictive cardiomyopathy, although the normal echo makes this less likely as well.

Regarding a phrenic nerve issue, what specific investigations would you recommend? Would a diaphragmatic ultrasound or fluoroscopy be helpful in assessing function? Are there any particular clinical features I should be looking for that might suggest phrenic nerve involvement? The suggestion of a psychogenic component is interesting, although I'm hesitant to go down that route without thoroughly exploring all other organic possibilities first.

If those tests are negative, before pursuing a psychogenic component, I'd like to consider a few more points. First, could we be dealing with a very unusual presentation of a mediastinal mass or tumor causing external compression on the heart or great vessels, even if it's not readily apparent on the chest x-ray?

The rash is described as firm and greasy-feeling, especially on the forehead. Importantly, the patient reports increasing fatigue and progressive dysphagia, primarily with solids. While the initial blood work, including CBC and CMP, came back normal, the constellation of these symptoms raises a red flag. The skin changes, coupled with the dysphagia and fatigue, point towards a connective tissue disorder, with scleroderma being high on my differential. The greasy-feeling bumps on the forehead could be consistent with sebaceous gland hyperplasia, sometimes associated with scleroderma. The reported difficulty swallowing solids suggests esophageal involvement, a common feature of scleroderma"

Normal x-rays don't visualize cartilage. * **Ligament damage:** Though less likely with a normal x-ray and no instability reported, it's still a possibility. * **Early osteoarthritis:** While less likely with a normal x-ray, the chronic nature, morning stiffness, and progressive worsening of symptoms warrant further evaluation by an orthopedist."

This 53-year-old patient presents with progressively worsening blurry vision, more pronounced in the right eye, accompanied by lower eyelid retraction and occasional pain behind the eyes, especially with upward or lateral gaze. She also reports increased sensitivity to light. Interestingly, initial thyroid panel, CBC, and orbital imaging (CT/MRI) were normal. She denies any double vision, changes in appetite, thirst, or bowel habits. She does report some mild mood changes, attributing them to anxiety about her vision. She has a history of corneal transplants in both eyes. My initial suspicion was Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) given the eyelid retraction and blurry vision, but the normal thyroid function tests and lack of other systemic symptoms make that less likely. Given the pain on eye movement and light sensitivity, I'm now leaning towards an inflammatory or infiltrative process. My questions for you are: 1. What are"

To help differentiate, I'd like to know more about the characteristics of the blurry vision. Is it primarily related to reduced visual acuity, or is there a significant component of distorted vision (metamorphopsia)? This could help distinguish between issues affecting the cornea/lens versus the retina/optic nerve. Regarding scleritis, has the patient reported any redness or tenderness of the sclera itself?

Before we proceed with these tests, I have a few more clarifying questions based on your recommendations and the patient's history. Regarding the proptosis assessment, should we consider formal exophthalmometry for a more precise measurement, or would a clinical assessment using a Hertel exophthalmometer suffice initially? Secondly, considering the possibility of an inflammatory process, even with normal orbital imaging, should we consider a trial of high-dose corticosteroids to see if the patient's symptoms improve?

While orbital pseudotumor is high on the differential, the lack of significant pain and the predominantly blurry vision, rather than diplopia, make me wonder if we should consider other inflammatory conditions affecting the optic nerve itself, such as optic neuritis. Could the pain she experiences be referred pain from the optic nerve rather than direct orbital inflammation? Should we consider visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to assess optic nerve function?

While the urine culture was negative, ruling out a standard UTI, the combination of hematuria, pyuria, and eosinophilia points towards a less common etiology. My initial differential included a parasitic infection, particularly Schistosoma haematobium given the urinary symptoms, although we haven't been able to obtain microscopy results for that yet. I've also ordered stool ova and parasites to broaden the search for other parasitic causes. The patient denies any recent international travel, which lowers the suspicion for some parasitic infections, but doesn't exclude them entirely.

I'm leaning more towards a parasitic infection, drug reaction, or even a systemic vasculitis as more probable explanations for the constellation of findings. Before we jump to a cystoscopy, I'd like to get the results of the stool ova and parasites, the ANCA, and ANA tests.

However, the laryngoscopy revealed white plaques, and the biopsy confirmed laryngeal candidiasis. The positive Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain clinched the fungal etiology. His daily use of inhaled corticosteroids for COPD likely predisposed him to this infection. While the diagnosis seems straightforward, I have a couple of questions. First, although the patient denies any oral thrush, I'd like to confirm you visually inspected the oral cavity during the laryngoscopy. Sometimes subtle oral candidiasis can be missed by the patient. Second, given the initial concern for malignancy, and the fact that candidiasis can sometimes coexist with or mask early cancers, did you observe anything else during the laryngoscopy that might raise suspicion?

That, coupled with the patient's smoking history, is what keeps me slightly uneasy despite the biopsy results. My thinking is this: while the GMS stain confirms the presence of fungal elements, it doesn't entirely rule out a coexisting lesion. Hyperkeratosis, as seen in the biopsy, can be associated with both fungal infections *and* premalignant changes. Could the fungal infection be superimposed on an area of dysplasia or even carcinoma in situ? Therefore, in addition to the repeat laryngoscopy, I would recommend sending the initial biopsy specimen for a second opinion from another pathologist, specifically asking them to evaluate for any dysplastic or malignant features beneath or adjacent to the fungal elements.

I'm leaning towards systemic therapy to ensure adequate penetration and address any potential submucosal involvement. 2. **For the repeat laryngoscopy:** What timeframe are we looking at post-antifungal treatment?

I'm leaning towards the latter, as it would allow us to sample any persistent or recurrent lesions specifically. 2. **Considering the patient's COPD:** Are there any specific precautions we should take regarding the systemic antifungal therapy, given his underlying respiratory condition? I'm thinking primarily of potential drug interactions with his COPD medications, or any increased risk of respiratory side effects. Should we consider a pulmonary consult, or is that generally unnecessary in this situation? 3. **Finally,"

I agree that opportunistic infections are less likely given his CD4 count, but I'll keep CMV and unusual mycobacterial infections in mind if the HSV PCR and further investigations for FDE are negative. Could you elaborate on what specific tests you'd recommend for ruling out CMV and mycobacterial infection in this context? Would a tissue biopsy be sufficient, or would you recommend other tests like blood cultures or PCR from blood? Also, while the patient hasn't reported any other skin changes, could the lesions be a manifestation of cutaneous HIV itself, given the chronicity and recurrence? I know it's less common with a controlled viral load, but I want to make sure we're considering all possibilities. Finally, regarding the FDE, should we consider a drug challenge if the patient reports using one of the implicated medications? I understand that"

I agree that cutaneous HIV is less likely given his viral load, and I'll avoid a drug challenge for FDE, opting instead to investigate his medication history and consider discontinuation of any suspect drugs if possible. Given your recommendation against a drug challenge, and assuming the HSV PCR is also negative, what would be your next diagnostic step if the CMV and mycobacterial cultures and PCR are also negative? Are there any other infectious etiologies we should consider, such as fungal infections like deep or atypical mycoses? Could this be a manifestation of an inflammatory dermatosis, even though the biopsy suggests an infectious process? Also, I'd like to get your opinion on the significance of the patient's HIV status in this case. While his viral load and CD4 count are currently well-controlled, could there be a subtle immun"

Before we go down that road, I want to make sure we've exhausted the infectious possibilities. You mentioned a repeat biopsy for special stains and cultures, including fungal. Could you specify which special stains you'd recommend, given the biopsy findings we already have? Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) would cover most fungal pathogens, but are there others we should consider given the patient's HIV status? Also, regarding Beh\u00e7et's, the patient hasn't reported any oral or genital ulcerations, eye inflammation, or skin lesions elsewhere on the body. While genital ulcers are a hallmark of Beh\u00e7et's, the absence of other manifestations makes it seem less likely. Are there any atypical"

While a dermatologist could also be considered due to the skin manifestations, several factors point strongly towards an infectious disease specialist: * **Recurring sores with a cyclical pattern:** This suggests a potential underlying infection, possibly viral or bacterial, that goes through periods of latency and reactivation. * **Sexual history:** The patient reports multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use, increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). * **HIV-positive status:** This significantly compromises the patient's immune system, making them more susceptible to opportunistic infections and complicating the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions. Managing STIs in the context of HIV requires specialized knowledge. * **Swollen lymph nodes:** Tenderness in the groin area suggests lymphatic involvement, a common sign of infection. * **Doctor's ordered tests:** The doctor ordered tests for herpes and syphilis, clearly indicating suspicion of an STI.
