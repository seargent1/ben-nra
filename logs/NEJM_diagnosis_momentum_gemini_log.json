The patient also mentioned some mild itching and warmth, which can be consistent with ochronosis. Discontinuing the hydroquinone is the first step. My main questions for you are: 1. **Do you agree with the suspected diagnosis of exogenous ochronosis?** Are there any other conditions on the differential you'd consider given the clinical presentation and biopsy findings? I'm thinking specifically about things like melasma (which the patient self-treated for), drug-induced pigmentation, or even a rare possibility like amyloidosis, though the pigment description makes that less likely. 2. **What further investigations, if any, would you recommend?**"

While I'm fairly confident in the ochronosis diagnosis, I'd like to explore a couple of points for my own clarity. Given the patient initially self-treated for melasma, could you elaborate on how the Wood's lamp examination would help differentiate between residual melasma and ochronosis? I understand melasma typically appears as a darker brown under Wood's lamp, but I'm curious about how ochronosis presents, especially in the context of pre-existing melasma.

Given the potential for slow improvement, and the patient's initial concern being melasma, I want to be proactive in managing their expectations and also consider potential combination therapies if the ochronosis doesn't resolve completely. What topical or procedural treatments would you consider for residual hyperpigmentation or for ochronosis that is slow to respond, assuming the hydroquinone is discontinued? Are there any specific treatments that work synergistically or are contraindicated in the context of exogenous ochronosis? I'm thinking about things like topical retinoids, chemical peels, laser therapies, or even cryotherapy.

Are there any specific parameters or settings you would recommend for these lasers in this context? 2. You advised against cryotherapy. Could you elaborate on why it's not recommended in exogenous ochronosis? Is it due to the risk of hypopigmentation, scarring, or other complications? 3.

The presentation of prolonged fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and weight loss certainly raises red flags. While initial tests for common tropical diseases like malaria, Chagas disease, and toxoplasmosis were negative, and the lymph node biopsy was unremarkable, the persistent fevers and lymphadenopathy, coupled with the peripheral eosinophilia, suggest we haven't yet hit the mark. The patient's exposure to stray animals in Brazil, particularly the mention of a dog nip, even if superficial, makes me consider zoonotic infections.

Would a local anesthetic be more likely to help differentiate a sensory component, or are we grasping at straws at this point? Perhaps we should prioritize the laryngoscopy to get a better visualization of the larynx and rule out any structural abnormalities or inflammation before pursuing further symptomatic treatment. Given the negative responses regarding travel, should we"

The lack of significant itching, ulceration, or pain is also atypical, though not unheard of in early NL.

However, I'll re-emphasize the question, focusing on even minor, forgotten trauma, as that can sometimes trigger NL or other granulomatous reactions. Regarding your differential, I agree granuloma annulare (GA) should be considered. However, the long-standing nature of these lesions (8 years) makes GA less likely, as it tends to resolve spontaneously within a couple of years. Could you elaborate on why you suspect sarcoidosis?

The atypical lymphocytes aggregating intravascularly, along with the positive CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1 staining, are quite specific. The significantly elevated LDH also corroborates the diagnosis of an aggressive lymphoma. I have a few questions: 1. Were any atypical lymphocytes seen on the peripheral blood smear? IVLBCL often has minimal peripheral blood involvement, but it's worth checking. 2. Has any imaging been performed, such as a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis?

This could influence prognosis and treatment approach. Also, while the immunohistochemistry points strongly towards B-cell origin, could we consider flow cytometry on the biopsy specimen to further characterize the immunophenotype and rule out any unusual subtypes? Finally, given the patient's initial presentation mimicking Kaposi's Sarcoma, I'd like to confirm that an HIV test was performed and was negative. While the biopsy findings are definitive for IVLBCL, it's important to consider the possibility of co-infection, especially given the initial clinical picture.

There's some evidence suggesting that rituximab alone can sometimes achieve rapid responses in IVLBCL with significant skin disease, potentially mitigating some of the immediate morbidity associated with full combination chemotherapy. This could be particularly relevant if the patient's overall performance status is compromised by the systemic symptoms. Also, given the unusual presentation mimicking Kaposi's Sarcoma, and while I understand the biopsy is definitive for IVLBCL, I'm still curious about the possibility of a concurrent process. Even with a negative HIV test, could we consider HHV-8 testing, just to be absolutely thorough?

While the biopsy is definitive for IVLBCL, the prominent skin involvement preceding other systemic symptoms is atypical. Therefore, before initiating R-CHOP, I would strongly advocate for a PET/CT *and* a dedicated skin biopsy specifically for HHV-8 staining, in addition to the already planned tests. This would allow us to definitively rule out any co-existing HHV-8 infection contributing to the cutaneous manifestations. While HHV-8 is unlikely to significantly alter the initial chemotherapy approach, confirming its absence or presence could influence supportive care and long-term monitoring.

My concern stems from the atypical presentation and the dramatic LDH elevation. While the biopsy confirms IVLBCL, the possibility of a concurrent process, even if unlikely, warrants consideration, especially given the potential impact on long-term management. Therefore, my suggestion is to initiate a \"modified\" induction approach. We could start with rituximab monotherapy immediately. This would provide some initial cytoreduction, particularly targeting the B-cells and potentially addressing the cutaneous manifestations, without the full toxicity of R-CHOP. This \"bridge\" would allow us the few extra days needed to obtain the PET/CT and HHV-8 results. Once those results"

However, the echo and cath results point towards constrictive pericarditis, showing pericardial calcification, pleural effusions, ventricular interdependence, and discordance of pressure tracings. The patient denies any history suggestive of the common causes of constrictive pericarditis, such as prior cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, or infection (including TB). They also deny a history of autoimmune disease, kidney disease requiring dialysis, or constitutional symptoms like fever, night sweats, or weight loss. My primary concern is the constrictive pericarditis given the imaging findings. While the patient's symptoms *could* be explained by heart failure, the specific findings on the echo and cath are more specific for constriction.

I'm particularly concerned about malignancy given the insidious onset and lack of other explanatory factors. Before we proceed with the biopsy, I'd like to get a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for any lymphadenopathy or other signs of malignancy that might guide the biopsy approach. Additionally, a serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation should be performed to screen for amyloidosis, as you suggested. While we're considering rarer causes, should we also consider sarcoidosis? Although the patient doesn't have other typical symptoms, it can sometimes present with predominantly cardiac involvement. Perhaps a serum ACE level and calcium level would be helpful. Finally, I'm curious about the degree of functional impairment. Has a six-minute walk test been"

I'm particularly interested in the results of the CT scan. If it reveals any mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, it would strengthen the suspicion for lymphoma or sarcoidosis. Similarly, any evidence of parenchymal lung disease could point towards sarcoidosis or even an underlying connective tissue disorder, although the patient hasn't reported any other symptoms suggestive of those conditions.

I agree that cutaneous sarcoidosis is less likely, but I appreciate you confirming that it's a reasonable consideration given the broad distribution and nail changes. Before we conclude, I have two final questions. First, while the factor XIIIa stain is helpful for NXG, are there any other specific immunohistochemical stains that would be beneficial in this case, perhaps to help rule out other granulomatous conditions or further characterize the infiltrate? Second, given the patient's age and the presence of MGUS, should we consider performing any imaging studies, such as a PET/CT scan, to further evaluate for any underlying hematologic malignancy, even though the bone marrow biopsy was normal? I understand this might be a low yield, but I want to be thorough, especially given the potential association between NXG and hematologic disorders."

The progression from a small patch to a more widespread, angrier-looking rash over four months is also consistent with shingles, though the duration is a bit longer than typical. I've requested both antibody and PCR tests for Herpes Zoster, but unfortunately, we don't have those results yet. I'm a bit puzzled by the lack of reported prodromal pain or tingling, which is a hallmark of shingles. I've asked the patient repeatedly about this, but they deny experiencing any such sensations.

I agree that the PCR and antibody test results are crucial, and I'll follow up with the lab to expedite them. In the meantime, given the atypical presentation, are there any other conditions we should consider for the differential diagnosis, perhaps something mimicking the vesicular stage of shingles? Could it be a particularly stubborn case of contact dermatitis, perhaps an allergic reaction to a new clothing item or detergent, even if the patient doesn't recall any such exposures?

I'll ask about recent outdoor activities and potential exposure to insects. Friction blisters are also a good thought, though I'd expect the patient to be aware of ill-fitting clothing causing consistent rubbing in that area. Still, I'll inquire about that as well. Regarding atypical contact dermatitis, I'm curious about what might make it present so persistently in a linear pattern. Could you elaborate on what might cause such a presentation? Are there specific allergens or irritants that tend to cause linear dermatitis? I appreciate the guidance on a biopsy and direct immunofluorescence.

Sometimes, indirect contact through clothing or pets can cause these reactions. To clarify, would the linear pattern in phytophotodermatitis typically be as well-defined and consistent as described in this case, almost like a stripe or belt?

My primary differential diagnosis is indeed pulmonary TB. However, we need to consider other possibilities. Given the patient's history of asthma and allergies, could this be a severe, atypical pneumonia or even bronchiectasis exacerbation? While less likely given the systemic symptoms, we should also consider other infections like fungal pneumonia (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis depending on geographic location) or even a non-infectious process like lung cancer, though the timeline seems a bit rapid for that. Lymphoma is another remote possibility. To clarify and refine the diagnosis"

Knowing their residence and any recent travel within the country, even if not international, could help narrow down which fungal infections are more likely and guide serology selection. For instance, if they live in the Ohio or Mississippi River valleys, Histoplasmosis would be higher on the differential.

Would you recommend adding a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and perhaps a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level to the initial workup?

Are there any specific parameters on the topography, besides the typical keratometric readings, that we should pay close attention to that might suggest early or masked ectasia? Also, regarding the endothelial cell count, what would be considered a concerningly low number in this patient's context, given their history of transplants? Is there a threshold below which we should be more suspicious of graft failure or other complications, even in the absence of overt"

This hemolysis is the direct cause of the patient's jaundice (from bilirubin buildup), dark urine (from bilirubin in the urine), and fatigue (from anemia). While liver function tests would likely be abnormal in the setting of hemolysis, the primary issue is the destruction of red blood cells, which falls squarely within the expertise of a hematologist.

Given his age and the constellation of findings, are there any other less common conditions we should consider at this stage, even if they are low probability? For example, are there any specific glomerulonephritides beyond IgA nephropathy that might present with this picture, particularly with the eosinophilia? I'm thinking along the lines of HSP, although he doesn't have the classic rash or joint pain. Also, while the renal ultrasound was normal, could there be subtle findings we might have missed that would warrant further imaging, like a CT or MRI?"

Are there any other systemic conditions that could cause both eosinophilia and hematuria, even in the absence of other overt symptoms? I'm thinking about things like hypereosinophilic syndromes, although those usually present with more multi-system involvement. Should we consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for underlying hematologic disorders, or is that premature at this stage?

The biopsy and Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain confirming the fungal infection were reassuring. The patient's long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids for COPD, without a spacer, clearly predisposed him to this. I've already advised him on the importance of using a spacer to minimize the risk of oral and laryngeal candidiasis in the future. My main question for you is regarding management.
