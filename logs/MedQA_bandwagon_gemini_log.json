The fluctuating and fatigable weakness, particularly affecting the ocular, bulbar, and proximal limb muscles, along with the worsening of symptoms in the evening and improvement with rest, are all classic for MG. The positive antibody test, along with the absence of other neurological findings, essentially confirms the diagnosis in my mind. The normal chest CT scan rules out a thymoma, which is present in a subset of MG patients. However, I have a few questions before we finalize the management plan. First, I'd like to confirm the specific titer of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies. A high titer further strengthens the diagnosis.

Given the relatively mild symptoms at present, I'm hesitant to jump straight to immunosuppressants like prednisone, but we should certainly discuss that as a next step if pyridostigmine alone isn't sufficient. I'm also curious about your thoughts on thymectomy. Her CT scan didn't show a thymoma, but I understand thymectomy can still be beneficial in some MG patients even without a thymoma.

Did the patient report any dry mouth, constipation, or other autonomic issues?

First, do we have the results of the patient's JC virus antibody test from before starting natalizumab? This is crucial for confirming the risk factors associated with PML development. Second, while the patient denies cognitive changes, I'm still slightly concerned about subtle cognitive deficits that might be masked by the more prominent motor symptoms. Could we consider a brief neuropsychological assessment to further evaluate this? Third, the patient is understandably apprehensive about plasma exchange.

While plasma exchange is crucial for removing the natalizumab, what are your thoughts on monitoring for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)? It's a known complication after starting PML treatment, and I want to be prepared to manage it if it arises. Do you have a preferred approach for monitoring and managing IRIS in this context? Also, given the patient's Crohn's disease, discontinuing natalizumab will necessitate finding an alternative treatment strategy.

While we haven't seen currant jelly stools, their absence doesn't rule out intussusception at this stage. I'm also wondering about other potential causes of obstruction, such as a less common congenital anomaly like Hirschsprung's disease, though the acute onset makes this less probable. Could the lack of vomiting and unclear bowel movement history point towards something like an incarcerated hernia, even though the pain seems more diffuse than localized?

Regarding the incarcerated hernia, should we be considering an ultrasound of the groin area in addition to the abdominal ultrasound, or would the abdominal ultrasound likely pick up an incarcerated hernia as well? Also, while I appreciate Hirschsprung's is less likely with the acute presentation, is there any scenario where a chronic, partial obstruction from Hirschsprung's could suddenly decompensate and present like this?

Given the splenomegaly and initial lymphadenopathy, even with the negative PET and bone marrow biopsy, could we consider a less common lymphoma subtype, such as a marginal zone lymphoma or a primary splenic lymphoma? These might not always show up clearly on PET scans. Would a repeat abdominal ultrasound with Doppler be helpful to assess the spleen further and look for any vascular abnormalities? Also, considering the patient's abdominal fullness and lack of response to standard GI workup, could we explore other less common GI issues?"

While Whipple's is rare, the constellation of symptoms warrants consideration. Regarding the possibility of a marginal zone lymphoma or primary splenic lymphoma, would a splenectomy be considered for diagnostic purposes if the CT abdomen/pelvis doesn't provide definitive answers? I understand this is a significant procedure, but it could provide the necessary tissue for a definitive diagnosis. Finally, given the patient's persistent fatigue and low mood, even in the absence of widespread lymphoma, could we consider inflammatory markers beyond the previously ordered ESR and CRP?

The initial supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, while concerning, hasn't been fully explained. While the CT scan showed enlarged axillary, mediastinal, and cervical lymph nodes, the PET scan was negative. Could this be explained by a localized inflammatory process rather than a malignancy? Should we consider a biopsy of one of the other enlarged lymph nodes, perhaps an axillary node, for comparison with the initial supraclavicular node biopsy?

She reports some instability, particularly with pivoting movements, and a feeling that the knee might give way. Importantly, she denies any popping or tearing sensation at the time of injury or any locking or catching of the joint. There's no reported radiation of pain. While rest offers some relief, ice and ibuprofen have been ineffective. The physical exam revealed no effusion or warmth, and an x-ray confirmed no fractures or dislocations.

While the mechanism of injury and symptoms do point towards a meniscus tear or MCL sprain, the absence of a popping or tearing sensation at the time of injury makes me wonder if the injury might be less severe than initially suspected. Could the symptoms also be consistent with a medial plica syndrome or even a pes anserine bursitis, given the location of the pain?

I agree that pes anserine bursitis and plica syndrome are less likely with the instability, but I wanted to consider them given the medial pain location. I'll initiate a course of conservative management with physical therapy focusing on strengthening the supporting musculature around the knee and improving joint stability. To clarify regarding the MRI, you suggest waiting 4-6 weeks and proceeding only if there's no improvement. If the patient experiences any worsening of symptoms or increase in instability during that period, should we obtain the MRI sooner? Also, are there any specific physical therapy exercises or modalities you would recommend or advise against in this case, given the suspected meniscus or MCL involvement? Finally, should we consider a prophylactic knee brace for added stability during activities, or would that potentially hinder the strengthening process?"

While the mechanism and medial pain make lateral involvement less likely, I agree it's important to consider. Could a combined injury, perhaps involving both the MCL and the lateral meniscus, be a possibility, even if less common? I'm thinking this because the patient mentioned a feeling of instability, which could potentially be exacerbated by a lateral meniscus injury even if the primary pain is medial. Also, regarding the conservative management approach, what would you consider the key indicators for surgical intervention, assuming the symptoms don't resolve with PT?

While an echo is often sufficient, a cardiac MRI might provide more detailed information about the myocardial structure and function, especially if the echo is inconclusive. Also, considering his age and the sudden nature of the event, could we be missing something vascular, like a transient ischemic attack (TIA) mimicking syncope?

The infant presents with a classic triad for Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS): congenital cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and a cardiac defect (PDA). The positive Rubella IgM antibody further solidifies this diagnosis. While the mother denies a rash during pregnancy, subclinical or unrecognized infection is certainly possible, especially given the lack of prenatal care. My main questions at this point revolve around confirming the diagnosis and assessing the extent of organ involvement. 1. Could we confirm the Rubella IgM result with a Rubella IgG avidity test? This will help differentiate between a recent infection and one that occurred earlier in the pregnancy. A low avidity IgG would support recent infection and strengthen the case for CRS. 2. Has the infant been screened for other common manifestations of CRS, such as hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenic purpura, or growth restriction? These findings, while"

The 1cm margin also seems appropriate, and I will ensure intraoperative margin assessment is performed. I appreciate the recommended follow-up protocol. Just a couple more points to clarify before we conclude: 1. While we suspect a phyllodes tumor, the rapid growth does raise the possibility of other less common but more aggressive diagnoses. Although the core biopsy showed leaf-like structures, could you comment on the possibility of a metaplastic carcinoma or a sarcoma, and what features on the biopsy slides would help distinguish these from a phyllodes tumor? Are there any immunohistochemical stains you'd recommend to further refine the diagnosis, especially if the final pathology after excision shows ambiguous features? 2.

I agree that metaplastic carcinoma and sarcoma are less likely, but given the rapid growth, I want to be thorough. I will definitely offer a referral to psychosocial oncology for her anxiety. Before we conclude, I have two final questions. First, while the current imaging points towards a single mass, is there a role for preoperative MRI in this case to better assess the extent of the tumor and rule out any multifocality, or would this be unnecessary given the planned wide local excision? Second, assuming the final pathology confirms a phyllodes tumor, and margins are clear after the wide local excision, what are your thoughts on adjuvant radiotherapy in this scenario? Some studies suggest a benefit in reducing local recurrence, particularly for larger tumors or those with close margins, but I'm interested in your perspective on its routine use in this context."

The doctor's ordered tests (urinalysis, CBC, and pelvic ultrasound) are also consistent with the diagnostic approach an OB/GYN would take for these types of postpartum concerns."

The bright red blood mixed with stool, the lack of significant changes in bowel habits, the normal FIT, the absence of constitutional symptoms, and the findings on digital rectal exam and anoscopy all point in that direction. The patient's confirmation of mucus, straining, and low fiber diet further strengthens this diagnosis. However, I do have a few questions and thoughts I'd like to discuss: 1. Given the patient is willing to undergo a colonoscopy in the future, would you recommend scheduling it sooner rather than later, despite the low suspicion for anything more sinister? I'm thinking it might be prudent given the patient's age (presumably over 45 if screening is being discussed) and the presence of rectal bleeding, even if likely hemorrhoidal. 2."

My second question relates to the patient's diet and lifestyle. They admit to a low-fiber diet, straining, and only drinking about 4-5 glasses of water a day. Do you have any specific recommendations beyond the general advice to increase fiber and fluid intake? Are there any particular fiber supplements or dietary changes you've found to be most effective in managing hemorrhoids? I'm also curious about the role of pelvic floor exercises in this case.

Regarding the colonoscopy prep, given the likely hemorrhoid diagnosis, are there any specific prep considerations we should take into account to minimize discomfort or potential complications related to the hemorrhoids themselves? 2. While unlikely given the presentation and negative FIT, should we consider any additional blood work prior to the colonoscopy, such as a complete metabolic panel or iron studies, to assess for any underlying anemia or other potential contributing factors?

The patient reports a metallic/dirt-like taste aura preceding the events. The EEG shows interictal epileptiform discharges localized to the temporal lobes, predominantly right-sided. Additionally, the patient reports experiencing olfactory hallucinations (burnt toast smell) and episodes of unprovoked fear. The frequency of these events is a few times per week. My primary diagnosis is temporal lobe epilepsy, specifically right temporal lobe onset. The aura, ictal symptoms, and EEG findings strongly support this.

Regarding Panayiotopoulos syndrome, I understand it's less likely given the EEG findings. The prominent interictal discharges in the temporal lobe seem more characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.

Given the patient's age and the possibility, albeit remote, of a benign focal epilepsy, would you recommend a video EEG monitoring period, even with the fairly clear interictal findings we already have? I'm thinking it might be helpful to capture an event and confirm the semiology, especially considering the somewhat vague description of the hand movements provided by the brother.

REQUEST TEST: [CT scan of the right hip and pelvis *STAT*, and bilateral knee X-rays *STAT*]. I'll be back to discuss the results and next steps as soon as they are available."

Should we consider an abdominal CT scan as well, or perhaps some blood work to check for any markers of internal injury?

That's helpful. Just to be completely thorough, are there any other, albeit less common, conditions that can mimic Hirschsprung's disease on contrast enema that we should keep in mind, even if they are less probable given the classic transition zone? For instance, are there any variations of intestinal neuronal dysplasia or other motility disorders that could present similarly? Also, regarding the management of the colostomy in the interim period, are there any specific recommendations for colostomy care in a neonate that we should be particularly mindful of, given their delicate skin and smaller size? Finally, while we await the biopsy results, should we initiate any specific supportive measures, such as electrolyte monitoring or specific nutritional recommendations, given the potential for malabsorption and dehydration in these cases?"

Just a couple of final clarifying questions: While we suspect Hirschsprung's, the baby hasn't passed any meconium at all. In cases of Hirschsprung's, isn't there sometimes a small amount of meconium passed after digital rectal examination or even spontaneously? The complete absence in this case, while not ruling out Hirschsprung's, makes me wonder if there could be a compounding factor, perhaps a meconium plug syndrome or something similar, co-existing with Hirschsprung's. Should we consider any additional imaging or investigations to rule out such a possibility? Secondly, regarding the intestinal neuronal dysplasia you mentioned, are there any specific histological"

This 38-week pregnant patient presenting with heavy vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and concerning fetal heart rate decelerations points towards a serious obstetric emergency. The sharp, tearing pain localized to her previous C-section scar, combined with the ultrasound findings suggestive of a uterine rupture, makes that the most likely diagnosis. Her lightheadedness and low blood pressure further support this, indicating possible hemorrhagic shock. My main concern is the potential for rapid deterioration of both the mother and fetus. While the ultrasound suggests a uterine rupture, I'd like to confirm a few things. First, was there any free fluid noted on the ultrasound, and if so, how much? This will help quantify the blood loss. Second, did the ultrasound visualize the fetus clearly, and was there any indication of fetal distress beyond the decelerations noted on the monitoring?

Knowing if there's a placenta previa or if the placenta is near the rupture site would significantly impact surgical management. Was there any mention of uterine contractions prior to the onset of bleeding and pain? While rupture is the primary concern, strong contractions in the presence of a previous C-section scar can sometimes cause dehiscence, which might present similarly, although typically less dramatically. I'd also like to know if the patient reported any recent trauma, even seemingly minor, that might have contributed to the rupture. Finally, while we're prepping for surgery, it would be prudent to have multiple units of blood crossmatched and readily available given the potential for massive hemorrhage."

Given the patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia, I'm concerned about the degree of hemorrhage. Has a central line been placed yet for more aggressive fluid resuscitation and closer hemodynamic monitoring? Also, while we're focused on the uterine rupture, it's important to consider other, albeit less likely, causes of bleeding in this scenario.

The patient presents with classic symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy, corroborated by the MRI findings of an L5-S1 disc herniation impinging on the nerve root. The sharp, stabbing pain radiating down the lateral aspect of the leg to the toes, exacerbated by movement and relieved by lying down, strongly suggests nerve root compression. My initial thoughts are that conservative management with physical therapy is a good first step, especially given the patient's preference to avoid injections at this stage. However, I have a few questions: 1. **Regarding the MRI, can you describe the extent of the herniation? Is it a protrusion, extrusion, or sequestration? Is there any evidence of foraminal stenosis?** This will help determine the severity of the compression and guide treatment decisions. 2. **Were there any other significant findings on the MRI, such as degenerative changes in other levels of the lumbar spine,"

I agree that while the presentation strongly suggests CMV retinitis, covering the less common differentials like toxoplasmosis, syphilis, and tuberculosis is prudent given his immunocompromised state. I will add those tests to the requisition for the retinal specialist. Regarding the patient's understanding of the situation, I've already stressed the importance of the urgent referral and the potential for vision loss if CMV retinitis is left untreated. I will reiterate this again before he leaves and ensure he understands the need for prompt follow-up. Given the patient is already on multiple medications, including ART and prophylaxis, I'm wondering about the best approach for initiating treatment if CMV retinitis is confirmed. While we await the CD4 count, would you recommend starting induction therapy with valganciclovir or ganciclovir empirically, considering the classic presentation and the potential for rapid progression, or would you prefer to wait for the confirmatory results from FA,"

Before we finalize the valganciclovir prescription, I have a couple of final clarifying questions: 1. Given the patient is already on a complex medication regimen, are there any specific drug interactions with valganciclovir, besides the aforementioned myelosuppression with TMP-SMX, that we should be particularly vigilant about? I'm thinking specifically about his ART regimen (efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine). 2.

My primary differential diagnosis, given the dermoscopy, is superficial spreading melanoma, given the relatively short history and the lesion's appearance. However, nodular melanoma needs to be considered given the growth rate.

No blood in the stool, no weight loss, and a normal appetite. The patient denies any known food allergies or intolerances, recent international travel, or family history of IBD. Initial stool studies for infection and ova/parasites were negative, and basic blood work including CBC and ESR were unremarkable, though the WBC is slightly elevated at 11,000. My initial differential includes IBS-D, IBD (though less likely given the lack of blood and normal inflammatory markers), microscopic colitis, and bile acid malabsorption.

The patient presents with shortness of breath, increased abdominal girth (likely due to ascites), and a known ovarian mass. The ultrasound confirms a large ovarian mass and the presence of ascites. While the CA-125 is normal, the combination of these findings raises strong suspicion for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated by gynecologic oncologists. Even if the mass turns out to be benign, a gynecologic oncologist is the best specialist to manage a large ovarian mass and perform the necessary surgery."
