She denies itching or pain but notes increased skin thickness, roughness, and sensitivity in the affected areas. She denies any personal history of autoimmune diseases or diabetes, but mentions the discoloration has darkened significantly in the last year. She also reports using a skin-lightening cream containing hydroquinone for two years, initially for melasma.

I agree that a biopsy is crucial for a definitive diagnosis. It will help differentiate exogenous ochronosis from other conditions like Riehl's melanosis, as you mentioned, and also rule out other pigment disorders or even something more serious. Given the patient's report of increased skin thickness and sensitivity, could this also suggest a lichenoid drug reaction, perhaps related to the hydroquinone? Should we consider patch testing to explore potential contact dermatitis or other allergic reactions contributing to the issue? Finally, while the distribution is characteristic of melasma and ochronosis, could we also consider other diagnoses like drug-induced pigmentation or even a very unusual presentation of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, given the underlying redness she describes?"

Before we schedule the biopsy, I'd like to explore the lichenoid drug reaction possibility a bit further. Could the thickened, roughened skin texture be a sign of this reaction, even if it's not overtly itchy? Are there any specific histological features we should look for in the biopsy to differentiate between ochronosis and a lichenoid reaction? Regarding the patch testing, should we wait until the hydroquinone has been discontinued for a period of time before proceeding?

I will ensure the pathologist is aware of these features when examining the biopsy. Two weeks seems like a reasonable timeframe to discontinue the hydroquinone before patch testing. I have a few remaining questions: 1. Given the patient's initial presentation of melasma, and the potential for chronic irritation to increase the risk of ochronosis, should we consider any other contributing factors besides the hydroquinone? Could hormonal influences, such as fluctuations related to perimenopause or other endocrine factors, have played a role in either the melasma or the subsequent development of ochronosis? Should we consider checking her thyroid levels, given the pigmentary changes? 2. Are there any specific topical or systemic treatments you would recommend for exogenous ochronosis once it's confirmed? I understand that it can be challenging to treat, but are there any modalities, such as"

Regarding the treatment options for exogenous ochronosis, I understand complete resolution is rare. Given the potential for lasers, peels, and retinoids to cause further irritation and potentially exacerbate the pigmentation, how do you typically approach sequencing these treatments? Would you recommend starting with a less aggressive approach like topical retinoids and then escalating to lasers or peels if there is insufficient response? Also, what is your experience with combination therapies for exogenous ochronosis? For example, would combining a topical retinoid with a depigmenting agent like topical ascorbic acid or kojic acid be beneficial, or could this increase the risk of irritation?

Two more questions come to mind: First, regarding the biopsy, if we do proceed with a bronchoscopy, would you recommend also performing endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) to sample the mediastinal lymph nodes seen on the chest x-ray? This could potentially provide a more definitive diagnosis, especially if the lung biopsy is non-diagnostic. Second, while sarcoidosis seems most likely, the patient's completely asymptomatic presentation aside from the cough is slightly unusual. Should we consider obtaining a rheumatology consult to evaluate for other connective tissue diseases, even in the absence of specific symptoms? Some of these can have pulmonary manifestations and might be worth exploring if the initial workup for sarcoidosis is inconclusive."

While not unheard of in sarcoidosis, it does make me wonder if we should consider less common etiologies. Given the crazy-paving pattern, should we consider pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) in our differential? While rare, it can present with a dry cough and similar radiological findings. Would you recommend adding a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and perhaps a serum SP-D level to the initial blood work to screen for PAP?

To further mitigate the risk of atrophy, could we consider combining the intralesional injections with a pulsed topical corticosteroid regimen, rather than continuous use?

Could the negative Histoplasma antigen test be a false negative, especially in a disseminated case? Would it be worthwhile to consider a urine Histoplasma antigen test as well, for increased sensitivity? Also, while the patient hasn't traveled, could they have been exposed to Histoplasma or other endemic fungi through activities like gardening or exploring caves, even locally?

Before I proceed with these tests, I have a few clarifying questions: 1. Regarding Bartonellosis, would you recommend testing for both *Bartonella henselae* and *Bartonella quintana*? While cat scratches are a common transmission route for *henselae*, I'm wondering about *quintana* given the patient's persistent fever and the possibility of exposure to body lice, even though they haven't mentioned any such exposure. 2. For Brucellosis, are there specific risk factors besides direct animal contact that I should inquire about, such as consumption of unpasteurized dairy products? 3"

Before I order these tests, I want to revisit the possibility of a non-infectious etiology, particularly in light of the negative initial infectious disease workup. While we're pursuing these less common infections, I'm still concerned about the possibility of a vasculitis or even a lymphoproliferative disorder. Regarding the ANCA panel, should we also consider testing for anti-phospholipid antibodies, given the skin findings and the potential for thrombotic events in some vasculitides?

They might have additional insights, particularly regarding the sclerodermoid changes and potential overlap syndromes. Also, while we're broadening our scope, should we consider testing for thyroid function again, even though it was previously reported as normal? I know thyroid disorders can sometimes present with skin changes and myxedema, although the waxy papules aren't typical. Perhaps a more comprehensive thyroid panel, including thyroid antibodies, might be worthwhile.

Also, while the presentation is classic, are there any other dermatological conditions we should consider in the differential diagnosis, given the described appearance and distribution of the rash?

This visual, combined with the history and Tzanck smear, makes me quite confident in the shingles diagnosis. To address your points: While contact dermatitis could present linearly, the patient denies exposure to new irritants, and the crusted lesions aren't typical of that diagnosis. Similarly, phytophotodermatitis usually presents with streaky or patterned erythema and blisters after exposure to certain plants and sunlight, which the patient also denies. Herpes simplex could be considered, but the distribution is less characteristic \u2013 it tends to favor mucocutaneous junctions and doesn't typically wrap around the torso in a dermatomal pattern like this.

Linear morphea is an interesting thought, but the patient's description of crusted lesions and intense itch doesn't really fit the typical presentation of indurated, discolored plaques seen in morphea. The timeframe of four months also argues against morphea, which tends to develop more slowly. Regarding post-herpetic neuralgia prophylaxis, that's an excellent point, and I intend to discuss it with the patient.

I also didn't note any obvious corneal vascularization or edema during my basic exam, but I acknowledge my limitations in assessing this without specialized equipment. That's why the referral is already in process. To clarify a few points and help refine the diagnosis before the ophthalmology appointment, could you tell me: 1. **Which signs/symptoms would help differentiate between early graft rejection and other potential causes like macular degeneration, aside from the eyelid retraction?** I'm particularly interested in what I can look for during my pre-referral exam, even with limited equipment. 2. **Given the patient's history of keratoconus in one eye, should we be more suspicious of rejection in that particular graft, even if"

Given that macular degeneration has been effectively ruled out by the lack of corneal findings and the presence of eyelid retraction, I'd like to focus on the graft rejection possibility. 1. **Could the type of corneal transplant performed (e.g., penetrating keratoplasty vs. endothelial keratoplasty) influence the presentation of rejection and the likelihood of lower eyelid retraction?** Knowing the type of transplant for each eye might help us predict the most likely type of rejection (epithelial, stromal, endothelial) we might be seeing. 2. **Are there any other less common causes of lower eyelid retraction we should consider in a post-transplant patient, even if"

I agree that a cystoscopy is definitely warranted to visualize the bladder and obtain biopsies if necessary. Given the negative urine culture and the presence of pyuria, could this be an atypical infection, perhaps a non-bacterial cause like a fungal or mycobacterial infection? Should we consider additional tests like PCR for atypical organisms in the urine, or perhaps serological testing for less common parasitic infections beyond Schistosomiasis?

One question I have \u2013 given the patient's young age (implied by the mention of his mother) and the absence of constitutional symptoms, how high on our differential should we place malignancy?

I agree that cutaneous lymphoma is less likely given the current biopsies, but I'll still review them with a dermatopathologist for a second opinion. The fungal culture is a good call, and I'll add that to the next set of tests. Given that we're still considering a possible drug reaction, even to a long-standing medication, could the recurring nature of these ulcers be explained by a dose-dependent accumulation of the drug or its metabolites? Could it be that the ulcers appear once a certain threshold is reached, then resolve as the drug levels decrease, only to reappear as the levels build up again with continued use? Also, while the patient denies any new medications *besides* his HIV medication, it's worth explicitly confirming that he hasn't changed the"

While initial STI tests were negative, the patient has a detectable HIV viral load. This makes an infectious disease specialist crucial for several reasons: * **HIV Management:** The specialist can assess the patient's HIV status, recommend appropriate antiretroviral therapy, and monitor disease progression. This is paramount given the presence of the sores and the potential for opportunistic infections. * **Diagnostic Expertise:** Infectious disease specialists are adept at diagnosing complex cases involving unusual or recurring infections. They can consider less common STIs, opportunistic infections related to HIV, or other infectious causes that may be contributing to the sores. * **Co-infection Management:** The specialist can investigate the possibility of a co-infection or interaction between HIV and another pathogen, which could explain the negative STI tests but persistent sores. * **Immune System Considerations:** The specialist can evaluate the patient"
