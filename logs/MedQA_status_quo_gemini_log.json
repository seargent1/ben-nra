The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms highly suggestive of Myasthenia Gravis (MG), including proximal muscle weakness, worsening with exertion and improving with rest, diplopia that's worse with upward and lateral gaze, and the reported difficulties with chewing and smiling, also worsening with use. The positive acetylcholine receptor antibody test significantly strengthens this diagnosis. However, before concluding definitively, I'd like to clarify a few points and suggest some additional investigations. 1. **Ocular MG vs. Generalized MG:** While the patient's symptoms point towards generalized MG, we need to ascertain the extent of ocular involvement. Was a formal ophthalmological assessment, including extraocular muscle function testing, performed? This will help determine if there are other subtle ocular findings we might have missed. 2. **Thymoma Screening:** Given the strong suspicion of MG, a chest CT scan is warranted to evaluate for the presence of a thymoma"

I have a few additional thoughts and questions: 1. **Regarding the onset:** The patient mentioned a gradual onset over a month. While this is typical for MG, I'd like to explore any potential triggers. Were there any preceding infections, vaccinations, or new medications started around that time, even seemingly unrelated ones? Sometimes, these can exacerbate or unmask underlying autoimmune conditions. 2. **Bulbar symptoms:** While the patient reports difficulty chewing and a weaker smile, I'd like to further clarify the extent of bulbar involvement. Have they experienced any difficulties with swallowing liquids or solids, changes in voice quality (nasal speech or hoarseness), or episodes of choking? A thorough assessment of swallowing function might be beneficial."

I have a few further considerations: 1. **Thyroid function:** While not directly related to MG, thyroid dysfunction can sometimes mimic or coexist with MG. Has a thyroid panel (TSH, free T3, and free T4) been performed? 2. **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):** While less likely given the proximal weakness and ocular involvement, LEMS should remain in the differential, particularly if the thymoma screening is positive. Voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies could be considered if the clinical picture remains unclear. 3. **Other autoimmune conditions:** Given the autoimmune nature of MG, it's worth considering"

Therefore, even if a sleep disorder is identified, it likely wouldn't fully explain the fluctuating weakness. 2. **Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS):** While single-fiber EMG is highly sensitive for MG, RNS is another electrodiagnostic test that could be considered. It's less sensitive than single-fiber EMG but more readily available in some centers. Have you considered RNS, and if so, what are your thoughts on its utility in this case? 3. **"

I have a couple of final thoughts: 1. **Ice Pack Test:** While not a replacement for formal diagnostic testing, a simple ice pack test could be performed quickly in the clinic. Applying an ice pack over the eyelids for a few minutes can sometimes temporarily improve ptosis in MG patients. This could provide further supportive evidence while waiting for more definitive studies. Has this been considered? 2. **Patient Education:** Given the likely diagnosis of MG, it's crucial to start educating the patient about the disease, its chronic nature, and the importance of long-term management.

This patient presents with a constellation of symptoms highly suggestive of PML, particularly given the MRI findings and the use of natalizumab for Crohn's disease.

The patient's report of gait and limb ataxia, right arm weakness, and cognitive fogginess further supports this. However, the negative JC virus antibody testing and normal blood work are somewhat puzzling. While these don't definitively rule out PML, they do necessitate careful consideration of other potential diagnoses. My primary concern is confirming or refuting PML. I believe a lumbar puncture to analyze CSF for JC virus DNA via PCR is crucial. While the serology was negative, PCR is more sensitive in detecting active JC virus infection within the CNS.

I don't have a record of recent vaccinations, but I'll check the patient's chart. ADEM is less likely given the progressive nature of the symptoms over several months, as ADEM usually presents more acutely. For MS, while the multifocal lesions could be considered, the lack of gadolinium enhancement on the MRI makes it less probable. Also, the patient hasn't reported any sensory symptoms like paresthesias, which are common in MS. Regarding NMOSD, it's important to consider, but the patient hasn't reported any optic neuritis or transverse myelitis, which are hallmark features.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis, for example, or even toxoplasmosis, although the latter typically presents with focal neurological deficits rather than the diffuse symptoms we're seeing. Should we consider adding these to the infectious workup alongside the JC virus PCR from the lumbar puncture? Also, regarding the MRI findings, were there any specific locations of the lesions that might point towards a particular diagnosis? For instance, periventricular lesions might favor MS, while lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum could suggest something else.

While PML is a serious condition requiring prompt treatment, initiating therapy based on presumptive diagnosis carries its own risks, and could complicate the diagnostic picture if the patient actually has a different condition. False-positive PML diagnoses have been reported, particularly in patients with MS receiving natalizumab. Wouldn't it be more prudent to await the CSF PCR results before making a treatment decision? The results should be available relatively quickly. Furthermore, discontinuing PML treatment if the diagnosis is subsequently refuted can be challenging, both logistically and for the patient.

Abdominal exam revealed distension, tenderness in the LLQ, and normal bowel sounds. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel segments and an absence of gas in the rectum, raising suspicion for an obstruction. A barium enema revealed a transition zone in the distal colon, highly suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. My primary concern is Hirschsprung's, although the age of presentation is a little later than typical.

He's a bit older than typical for those diagnoses, but could they present this late? I'm also curious about the possibility of a colonic stricture.

I agree that R-CHOP, potentially with the addition of polatuzumab vedotin for high-grade disease, is the most likely initial approach. I will keep that in mind as we await the further workup results. Regarding the potential for GI involvement, if the endoscopy reveals a primary GI lymphoma, would the surgical approach be different depending on the location and extent of the disease? For example, would a localized gastric lymphoma be treated differently than a more diffuse small bowel lymphoma? And in the case of surgical resection, would you still recommend adjuvant chemotherapy with R-CHOP or a similar regimen? Also, while we've focused on lymphoma, the patient's initial presentation with abdominal pain and constipation also raises the possibility, albeit less likely, of a non-hematologic malignancy with secondary lymph node involvement. While the biopsy strongly points towards lymphoma, are there any other diagnostic considerations we should keep in mind"

Although you mentioned post-streptococcal GN and IgA nephropathy are less likely, and we agreed to hold off on ASO titers and complement levels initially, could the sinusitis have potentially triggered a less common form of post-infectious GN or a mild vasculitis that's now being exacerbated by the antibiotic?

The negative X-ray rules out a fracture or dislocation, which is good. We're still waiting on the MRI results, which will be crucial for confirming the diagnosis. My primary differential diagnoses at this point are: 1. **Medial Meniscus Tear:** Given the mechanism of injury (increased activity, likely twisting motions in volleyball), location of pain, and the patient's report of a steady ache worsening with movement, this is high on my list. 2. **MCL Sprain:** Again, the mechanism and location of pain are consistent with this.

However, I'll re-evaluate for effusion now and consider an aspiration if it's present. Given the patient's recent increase in activity and focus on weight loss, I'm also wondering about the possibility of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), especially since the pain is described as being below the kneecap.

The doctor's line of questioning is systematically ruling out other potential causes (neurological, metabolic, etc.). Given the lack of other symptoms and the patient's denial of pre-existing conditions, a cardiac cause, such as an arrhythmia or vasovagal syncope (though the latter usually involves some prodromal symptoms which the patient denies), becomes a higher suspicion.

An echocardiogram is a good idea to rule out structural heart disease, although I'm less suspicious of that given his lack of cardiac history and symptoms. I'll definitely add that to the workup. I agree that a tilt table test could be helpful if the initial investigations are unremarkable. Before we proceed with those, I'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly, regarding micturition syncope, while the timing strongly suggests it, the lack of typical prodromal symptoms makes me slightly hesitant. Is it common for micturition syncope to present with minimal or atypical prodromes? Could the lightheadedness alone be sufficient? Secondly, given his age, should we consider carotid sinus hypersensitivity? While he denies any neck manipulation or tight collars, could this still be a possibility? Perhaps a carotid sinus massage (performed with appropriate precautions) could be considered if other tests are negative"

So, to summarize our plan, we'll start with an EKG, orthostatic vital signs, and blood work including electrolytes. If those are normal, we'll proceed with a 48-hour Holter monitor and an echocardiogram. If we're still without a clear diagnosis, we can then consider a tilt table test and carotid sinus massage. Does that sound like a reasonable approach? Assuming the patient is otherwise healthy and active, and the initial tests don't reveal any significant abnormalities, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of micturition syncope, even with the atypical presentation.

One final question \u2013 given that the patient experienced lightheadedness *before* the syncopal episode, albeit briefly, does that shift the likelihood towards vasovagal/neurocardiogenic syncope slightly more than pure micturition syncope? My understanding is that micturition syncope is often more abrupt, with less warning. Could the lightheadedness suggest a more general vasovagal response triggered by the act of urination, rather than a purely micturition-related mechanism? Or is this distinction not clinically significant in guiding our management? I'll keep you updated on the results of the investigations. I"

The doctor's line of questioning is systematically ruling out other potential causes (neurological, metabolic, etc.). Given the lack of other symptoms and the patient's denial of pre-existing conditions, a cardiac cause, such as an arrhythmia or vasovagal syncope (though the latter usually involves some prodromal symptoms which the patient denies), becomes a higher suspicion.

The patient reports no pain or tenderness associated with the mass, and her menstrual cycles are regular. She denies any family history of breast or ovarian cancer and is not taking any medications. While the clinical picture points towards phyllodes, I'd like to discuss a few points. First, given the rapid growth, I'm concerned about the possibility of malignancy. What are your thoughts on ordering an MRI to better assess the extent of the tumor and check for any axillary involvement? Secondly, I'm thinking a wide local excision is the most appropriate next step, with margins of at least 1cm, possibly more depending on the final pathology. Do you concur?"

I'm also curious about your thoughts on performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy during the excision. While lymphatic spread is less common with phyllodes tumors compared to other breast malignancies, the rapid growth does raise a flag. Do you think it's warranted in this case, or would you prefer to wait for the final pathology of the excised tumor? Also, given the potential for recurrence, even with negative margins, what's your preferred follow-up protocol for these patients? Finally, while less likely given the biopsy results, should we be considering other differential diagnoses like a sarcoma, given the rapid growth?

Just to clarify, if we see ill-defined margins or a lack of internal septations on the MRI, should we be more suspicious of a sarcoma, even with the characteristic leaf-like pattern on the core biopsy? Would you recommend a repeat core biopsy, potentially image-guided, for further histological analysis in such a scenario? Also, while we're discussing differentials, could we briefly touch upon fibroadenoma?

The short-interval follow-up imaging to assess for continued growth is a good strategy, but it does introduce a delay in definitive diagnosis and treatment. Given the patient's anxiety about the rapid growth already observed, I'm wondering if there's any value in adding a breast MRI with contrast enhancement to our initial imaging plan? Could the enhancement patterns potentially offer additional clues to differentiate between these two entities, or would the overlap in enhancement characteristics still make it inconclusive? Also, if we do opt for the short-interval follow-up imaging and observe continued growth, would you recommend proceeding directly to excision, or would another biopsy be warranted at that point, even if the initial biopsy suggested phyllodes?

She's five days postpartum after a long vaginal delivery of a large infant and presenting with a fever of 100.4\u00b0F, lower abdominal tenderness worsened by palpation and movement, and no bowel movement since before delivery. She reports increased urinary frequency and a tender uterus. While she denies chills, night sweats, and changes in vaginal discharge, the combination of fever, abdominal pain, and lack of bowel movement raises several red flags. My primary differential diagnoses include: * **Postpartum endometritis:** Given the fever, lower abdominal tenderness, and recent delivery, this is high on my list. However, the absence of foul-smelling lochia is somewhat atypical. * **Ileus:** The absent bowel movement, abdominal distension, and tenderness point towards this.

That's the next step, along with a rectovaginal exam to better assess for a hematoma. I'll also be looking for any signs of uterine tenderness, masses, and evaluating the lochia for color, consistency, and odor. Given her report of increased urinary frequency and uterine tenderness, I'm also wondering about a potential urinary tract infection (UTI). While she denies dysuria, UTIs can sometimes present atypically in the postpartum period. Would you recommend any additional imaging studies at this point, such as an ultrasound or CT scan? An ultrasound could help visualize the uterus and adnexa for any signs of infection or hematoma, and also assess for ileus. A CT scan might be helpful if we suspect a pelvic abscess, although that seems less likely at this stage."

During the pelvic exam, should I be particularly focused on assessing for any asymmetry or parametrial tenderness that might suggest a hematoma, even in the absence of a readily palpable mass? Also, regarding the ultrasound, should we add a Doppler study to specifically evaluate for DVT, given the leg swelling, even though it's painless?

The doctor's questions about bowel habits, stool characteristics (color, consistency, presence of blood and mucus), family history of colon cancer/GI issues, and the ultimate recommendation for a colonoscopy all point towards a gastrointestinal issue. While bright red blood *could* indicate a problem near the anus that might fall under a colorectal surgeon or even a proctologist, the doctor's thorough investigation of other digestive symptoms and the need for a colonoscopy makes a gastroenterologist the best initial specialist. They can perform the colonoscopy, diagnose the issue, and either manage the treatment themselves or refer to a more specialized surgeon if necessary."

The combination of the aura (muddy taste), facial grimacing, involuntary hand movements, brief periods of unresponsiveness, and post-ictal confusion is quite characteristic. The interictal spikes and sharp waves localized to the temporal lobes on the EEG further solidify this suspicion, especially with the right-sided prominence. However, I'd like to explore a few things with you. First, given the patient's age, I'm wondering if we should consider other potential mimics, even though they seem less likely.

I'll also consider a referral for a psychiatric evaluation to further explore this possibility. Regarding the absence of prior history, I was thinking along similar lines. While it doesn't rule out epilepsy, it does raise the question of whether something might have been missed in childhood. I'll delve deeper into the patient's early development with the parents.

Some migraine variants, especially those with aura, can indeed mimic seizures, and it's important to differentiate between the two. While the patient's aura of a \"muddy taste\" is more typical of TLE, it's not entirely exclusive to seizures. Are there any specific types of migraine auras that might present with gustatory hallucinations, or is that generally less common? I'm also curious about the frequency of these episodes.

My main concern is the delay in diagnosis and treatment. A week-old dislocation increases the risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. I'm glad we finally have the imaging confirming the suspected diagnosis. Before we discuss management, I have a few clarifying questions: 1. Do the X-rays provide any indication of associated fractures, particularly acetabular fractures or femoral head fractures, that might have been missed initially?

He is wetting diapers and attempting to feed, but the vomiting continues. He appears lethargic and cries with apparent abdominal pain. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel loops with no gas in the rectum, suggesting a distal obstruction. However, the contrast enema was normal, which is puzzling. This makes me question the initial interpretation of the X-ray, or perhaps there's a functional issue rather than a complete anatomical blockage. Given the bilious emesis so early in life, malrotation with midgut volvulus was high on my differential, but the normal contrast enema argues against that. Hirschsprung's disease is also a strong possibility given the lack of meconium passage and the distension. The normal contrast enema doesn"

The rectal suction biopsy will be crucial for confirmation. Before we proceed, I wanted to clarify a few points from the history. The mother reported the vomiting as greenish-yellow, and while she described it as forceful, she didn't specifically use the term \"projectile.\" The baby hasn't passed any gas, and there was no meconium plug observed after birth. The umbilical cord was reportedly normal with three vessels. The infant seems to experience discomfort particularly during feeding attempts.

Would it involve repeat imaging, further specialist consultation, or consideration of alternative treatment options like surgery or percutaneous pinning? Also, while we've discussed the lack of response to ibuprofen, should we consider adding another pain management strategy during the splinting period, such as a different NSAID, acetaminophen, or even a short course of opioids if the pain remains severe? Finally, are there any specific instructions or precautions we should give the patient regarding activities of daily living while the splint is in place?

He denies fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in the stool. He hasn't traveled recently and has no history of similar diarrhea episodes unrelated to antibiotic use. He reports consuming primarily clear broths, jello, and toast while in the hospital and hasn't supplemented with probiotics. He also reports mild lightheadedness upon standing. My primary suspicion is antibiotic-associated diarrhea, likely due to *Clostridium difficile* overgrowth, although the absence of fever is somewhat atypical. The lightheadedness suggests mild dehydration, which is consistent with the frequency of bowel movements.

In the meantime, I've started the patient on standard venous ulcer care, including compression therapy, leg elevation, and local wound care. I'm also prescribing a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic to address the possible cellulitis, pending the wound culture results. Given the necrotic appearance, should we consider a debridement once the infection is under control, or is it best to wait for the duplex and see if revascularization procedures might be necessary first? Also, while less likely given the overall picture, could we be dealing with something like pyoderma gangrenosum, considering the rapid progression and painful, necrotic nature of the ulcer? While it doesn't perfectly fit the classic presentation, I'd like to keep it in the differential, especially if the ulcer proves refractory to standard treatment. What are your thoughts on that? Finally, are there any specific markers in the wound culture"

I'll hold off on a biopsy for now, but if it doesn't respond to standard venous ulcer care and antibiotics, we'll definitely pursue that, perhaps with a dermatology consult. Given that PG is a diagnosis of exclusion, are there any other less common conditions we should consider at this stage, even if they're less likely? For example, could this be some form of vasculitis, or perhaps even a malignant ulcer, although the relatively short history argues against that? Should we consider a tissue biopsy sooner rather than later to rule out malignancy, even before exploring PG? Regarding the venous duplex ultrasound, are there any specific findings you'd be particularly looking for that might influence our management, beyond confirming venous reflux?

The venous duplex ultrasound will be crucial in guiding further management, particularly regarding the presence and extent of venous reflux and the possibility of DVT. Now, a couple of further clarifying questions: Regarding the biopsy, if we do proceed with one, should we obtain both a standard histopathology sample and a sample for cultures, or would the histopathology alone be sufficient at that stage?

This tragic outcome underscores the importance of considering concealed abruption, even in the absence of overt external bleeding.

The doctor's questions are geared towards assessing potential obstetric emergencies such as placental abruption, uterine rupture, or previa. These conditions require immediate intervention by a specialist trained in managing pregnancy complications."

However, before we jump to a definitive diagnosis, I'd like to clarify a few things. First, regarding the weakness \u2013 Dr. Agent, did the patient exhibit any specific neurological deficits on examination, such as diminished reflexes in the ankle or great toe, or demonstrable weakness on resisted dorsiflexion or plantarflexion? This would help confirm the level of nerve root involvement. Secondly, while a herniated disc is the most likely culprit, we should consider other potential diagnoses, albeit less probable.

Do you have any specific recommendations for ergonomic adjustments or strategies to minimize sitting time while he's working? Perhaps a sit-stand desk or specific exercises he can do throughout the workday? 2. **Pain Management:** While NSAIDs are a good starting point, did you have a particular NSAID in mind, or are you open to other pain management strategies if NSAIDs prove insufficient? Given the pain level, would you consider a short course of oral steroids or a muscle relaxant? 3. **Physical Therapy Modalities:** Are there any specific physical therapy modalities you'd recommend initially, such as traction"

A few more points to consider: 1. **Neurological Exam specifics:** When you examine the patient, could you pay particular attention to the strength of the extensor hallucis longus muscle? Weakness in this muscle is a strong indicator of L5 radiculopathy and can help differentiate it from S1. Also, assessing sensation along the lateral aspect of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot will be crucial. 2. **Cauda Equina Syndrome:** While unlikely given the presentation, it's essential to rule out cauda equina syndrome. Will you be specifically inquiring about bowel/bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, and sexual dysfunction during your examination? 3. **Imaging Correlation:** The MRI report mentioned impingement. Could you clarify if the impingement is on the exiting L5 nerve root or the traversing S1 nerve root? This distinction can sometimes be subtle"

A couple of final thoughts before you see the patient: 1. **Regarding the contralateral straight leg raise pain:** While the positive straight leg raise on the affected side is expected, the presence of pain on the contralateral side, even at a higher angle, raises a slight flag for me. While it could be due to referred pain or muscle spasm, it's worth considering the possibility of a broader central disc protrusion or even a second, smaller herniation affecting the opposite side. Could you assess for any tenderness or muscle spasm in the paraspinal muscles on both sides during your examination? 2. **Timing of surgical intervention:** Assuming conservative management is initiated, what are your typical benchmarks for considering surgical intervention?

Also, regarding assessing the other eye, should we perform a fluorescein angiography on both eyes to better delineate the extent of retinal involvement and look for subtle signs in the currently asymptomatic eye?

Would you be comfortable with running a toxoplasma IgG and syphilis RPR, along with perhaps a PCR for VZV (Varicella-Zoster Virus) from the aqueous humor to definitively rule out PORN, given its aggressive nature and potential for rapid vision loss? While the fundoscopic findings are typical for CMV, these tests could provide valuable information and guide further management if the patient doesn't respond as expected to the antiviral therapy.

Would you consider a less invasive alternative to aqueous humor sampling for VZV, such as a serum PCR for VZV DNA?

Therefore, in addition to the Chlamydia/Gonorrhea NAAT, would you recommend a gram stain and culture of the synovial fluid? Also, while the patient denies any recent diarrheal illness, some infections can be subclinical or forgotten. Would you consider stool studies for enteric pathogens like Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, or Yersinia, given they can also trigger reactive arthritis? Or would you consider this lower priority given the absence of reported GI symptoms? Finally, regarding the HLA-B27 testing, how much weight would you place on a"

I have a few final questions regarding ongoing management and prognosis: 1.

Specifically, what frequency of follow-up visits do you recommend, and what clinical and laboratory markers will you track? 2.

The cramping preceding bowel movements suggests a motility component. Importantly, the stool studies, including ova and parasites, are negative, and there's no blood in the stool. The patient denies fever, chills, or weight loss, making inflammatory bowel disease less likely, although not entirely ruled out. They also deny any significant dietary changes and report a relatively normal diet. The elevated white blood cell count is mildly concerning, but with a normal differential, it may be nonspecific. My initial differential includes irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional diarrhea, microscopic colitis, and bile acid malabsorption. Given the mucus in the stool and the lack of response to dietary changes so far, I'm leaning towards microscopic colitis or bile acid malabsorption. IBS is still possible, but the mucus"

However, given the negative stool studies and lack of other alarming symptoms, a trial of a low FODMAP diet could be helpful while we wait for the SeHCAT scan and colonoscopy. It could provide additional information and potentially offer some symptomatic relief in the meantime. Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few points.

Regarding the colonoscopy, should we consider biopsies even if the macroscopic appearance of the colon is normal? I'm thinking specifically of microscopic colitis, which, as you know, often presents with normal macroscopic findings. Also, are there any specific areas of the colon you'd recommend targeting for biopsies in this case?

I'm trying to balance thoroughness with cost-effectiveness for the patient. Also, given that we're expanding the differential to include celiac disease, should we modify the dietary recommendations at all?

This young woman presents with a concerning constellation of symptoms: progressive shortness of breath, increasing abdominal girth due to ascites, and a known ovarian mass. The pleural effusion, particularly on the right side, suggests possible metastatic spread or a reactive process. The absence of significant weight change is interesting, as is the normal CA-125. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is an ovarian neoplasm, possibly a borderline or low-grade malignancy. The ascites and pleural effusion point towards advanced disease, even with a normal CA-125. However, the relatively short timeframe of symptom onset (one month) is somewhat atypical for a slow-growing tumor. Other possibilities I'm considering include: * **Tuberculosis (TB):** While less likely given the ovarian mass, TB can cause ascites and pleural effusions. We should consider a PPD test or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test"

While Meigs syndrome is a possibility, the pleural effusion and the speed of symptom onset make me less inclined to consider it a primary diagnosis. I also agree with broadening the infectious workup. Given her age and the lack of constitutional symptoms like fever or night sweats, what specific infectious agents do you recommend we test for beyond TB? Chlamydia and Gonorrhea are possibilities, though she reports not being sexually active. Could a subclinical infection still be a driver? Also, given the right-sided pleural effusion and the lack of lung symptoms, should we consider a thoracentesis to analyze the pleural fluid? This could help differentiate between a malignant process and an infection. Finally, while her CA-125 is normal, would you consider ordering other tumor markers, such as HE4, CEA, or CA"

Given the patient's young age and the rapid accumulation of ascites, I'm still somewhat concerned about the possibility of a more aggressive process, even with the normal CA-125. While we await the biopsy results, should we consider any imaging beyond the ultrasound and chest x-ray already performed? Would a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, or even a PET scan, be beneficial at this stage to better assess the extent of the disease and look for any other potential sites of involvement?

Starting her on a low-sodium diet and diuretics for symptomatic relief of the ascites is a good idea as well. Before we proceed, I have a few remaining questions: 1. Given the patient's age and the possibility, albeit less likely, of a germ cell tumor, should we include AFP and beta-hCG in the tumor marker panel? 2. While we're pursuing the infectious workup, should we empirically start her on any broad-spectrum antibiotics while we await culture results, or would that confound the results? I'm thinking particularly in the context of possible pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), even though she denies sexual activity. 3. Regarding the CT abdomen/pelvis, should we also include the chest, given the right-sided"
