This patient presents with a one-month history of progressively worsening proximal muscle weakness, binocular diplopia, and ptosis, all exacerbated by exertion and worsening as the day progresses. This constellation of symptoms strongly suggests a neuromuscular junction disorder. My primary differential diagnosis is **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**. The fluctuating weakness, prominent ocular involvement (diplopia and ptosis), and characteristic fatigability are highly suggestive. The absence of muscle fasciculations and normal sensation also fit this picture. However, given the proximal limb weakness, I also want to consider **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)**. While LEMS typically presents with autonomic symptoms (which this patient doesn't seem to have prominently), the proximal weakness and fatigability can overlap with MG. The patient denies any history of malignancy, which is often associated with LEMS, but it's still worth investigating. Other, less likely differentials include"

Just to clarify regarding the LEMS testing, if the AChR antibodies are negative, should we then proceed with voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing and consider performing repetitive nerve stimulation *with* exercise, given that LEMS often shows facilitation after exercise, unlike MG which typically shows decrement? Also, while the patient denies any autonomic symptoms, are there any subtle autonomic features we should specifically inquire about that might point us towards LEMS even in the absence of classic dry mouth or impotence? For example, are there specific questions about temperature regulation, or subtle bowel/bladder changes that might be relevant? Finally, regarding the chest CT, if the AChR antibodies are"

We're reasonably excluding IBM and mitochondrial myopathies for now based on the fatigability and prominent ocular findings.

A couple of other, less likely, differentials crossed my mind, though I admit they are less probable given the biopsy results. Could the splenomegaly and early satiety be related to a separate process, like a lymphoproliferative disorder other than DLBCL, such as mantle cell lymphoma, given the GI symptoms?

The negative bacterial and urine cultures make a typical bacterial infection less likely. The patient also developed a diffuse maculopapular rash after starting the amoxicillin, further supporting the DIN diagnosis. My main question for you is: What further investigations, if any, would you recommend to confirm the diagnosis of DIN and rule out other potential causes?

My concern with just monitoring is the potential for ongoing inflammation to cause irreversible damage, even if the creatinine doesn't dramatically rise. Given the eosinophils in the urine, which strongly suggests an allergic/inflammatory process, wouldn't a short course of steroids be beneficial even *without* waiting for worsening renal function? It seems like a relatively low-risk intervention with potential for significant benefit in preventing long-term sequelae. What's your typical steroid regimen in a case like this?

Also, while the Holter was normal, are there any other, less common arrhythmias that might not be captured on a 24-hour recording but could still present like this? Finally, should we consider any further investigation into potential neurological causes, even though there were no focal neurological deficits and the event was so brief and seemingly benign?

Loss of consciousness is a serious symptom, and it's crucial to eliminate cardiac causes like arrhythmias or heart block before exploring other less serious possibilities. The doctor's caution and thoroughness in recommending a cardiology consult and a 24-hour Holter monitor, even after normal initial ECG results, demonstrates the importance of prioritizing cardiac evaluation in syncope cases."

While this infant's platelet count is currently within normal limits, I'm wondering about the potential benefit of IVIG in mitigating some of the inflammatory processes associated with CRS, even in the absence of severe thrombocytopenia. I understand the evidence base is limited, but I wanted to get your perspective on its potential use in this context."

My primary concern is ruling out malignancy.

Knowing the mitotic rate and the degree of stromal overgrowth will significantly impact our management plan. 2. **Even if benign, complete excision is necessary due to the size and potential for local recurrence.** I'm leaning towards a wide local excision with clear margins, rather than a simple lumpectomy, given the initial rapid growth.

Her elevated temperature of 100.4\u00b0F this morning, now 102\u00b0F, along with the uterine tenderness and increased urinary frequency, points towards this diagnosis. The increased urination without dysuria makes me wonder if there's some bladder irritation from the adjacent inflamed uterus, or perhaps mild dehydration contributing to the fever. The decreased bowel sounds could be related to the infection or simply postoperative ileus. The bibasilar crackles are a new development and slightly concerning; I'm wondering if this could indicate early pneumonia, perhaps aspiration related to the delivery, or even a developing septic picture.

If she shows signs of improvement, such as decreasing fever and tenderness, we can likely reduce the monitoring frequency to once daily.

The patient denies feeling a mass themselves, and I couldn't palpate one during my digital rectal exam, though I did find a prolapsable, non-tender mass consistent with prolapsed hemorrhoids. My primary concern is ruling out anything more sinister.

Fecal impaction seems unlikely given the lack of constipation or changes in bowel habits. The prolapse we observed during the DRE could certainly explain the initial finding, especially if it was intermittently prolapsing. Given the patient's description of straining, the prolapsed internal hemorrhoids seen on anoscopy, and the easily reducible prolapse felt on DRE, I'm leaning towards that being the most likely explanation for the initial \"mass.\" However, the sigmoidoscopy will definitively rule out other pathologies higher up in the rectum and sigmoid colon, such as polyps or malignancy, which is crucial for peace of mind given the bleeding.

Given that the patient is experiencing bleeding and we visualized internal hemorrhoids, should we consider recommending any specific treatment for the hemorrhoids at this point, or should we wait for the sigmoidoscopy results before initiating treatment?

Could you elaborate on why you think a TIA is less likely given the EEG findings? Is it the localized nature of the interictal discharges, suggesting a fixed epileptic focus rather than a transient vascular event? Regarding PNES, I agree that the EEG findings and stereotypical nature of the episodes make this less likely. However, given the patient's age, obtaining a thorough psychosocial history is crucial. I'll explore any potential stressors or emotional triggers that might be"

Did you have any thoughts on assessing sciatic nerve function pre- and post-reduction, perhaps with a quick neurological exam focusing on dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and sensation in the foot? Also, regarding the MRI post-reduction, I agree it's crucial to assess for labral and chondral damage.

We have a two-day-old male infant presenting with bilious vomiting after nearly every feed, abdominal distension, and a concerning lack of meconium passage. He has had a few wet diapers, but less than expected. Initial abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel loops with no gas in the rectum, suggestive of a distal obstruction. However, a contrast enema surprisingly showed normal findings. The birth was at home, unattended by medical professionals, and a thorough newborn exam, crucially including rectal examination, was not performed. My primary concern, given the normal contrast enema and the lack of a proper newborn exam, is Hirschsprung's disease. The absence of a meconium plug argues somewhat against meconium ileus, though it doesn't rule it out entirely, especially given the possibility of a less complete obstruction.

Although the lack of a meconium plug passed argues against meconium plug syndrome, could it be a case where the plug is higher up?

I'm strongly suspecting a mallet finger injury based on the mechanism of injury (finger caught in a jersey, forced flexion), the localized pain and swelling at the DIP joint, the inability to actively extend the distal phalanx, and the patient's report of pain with pressure at the dorsal aspect of the DIP joint. The absence of fracture on x-ray further supports this. My primary concern is differentiating between a tendon injury alone versus a bony mallet fracture, which can sometimes be subtle on initial x-rays. My initial assessment points towards a closed mallet finger, likely involving the extensor tendon. The patient reports the fingertip \"droops\" but isn't completely flat against the pad, suggesting the tendon may be stretched or partially torn rather than completely ruptured. The subungual hematoma also suggests a significant force was involved. Before we discuss management, I'd like to clarify a few points"

I agree that repeat x-rays in 7-10 days are warranted to rule out a delayed presentation of a bony avulsion. My main question now revolves around the best splinting strategy. Given the slight angle at the DIP joint, suggesting a potential partial tear, do you recommend a stack splint, or would a full extension splint be more appropriate? I'm leaning towards a stack splint initially to avoid over-tensioning the tendon if it's only partially torn. Also, what's your preferred duration of splinting for a suspected tendon injury versus a bony mallet fracture? Finally, should we consider an immediate referral to hand therapy, or should we wait and see how the finger responds to splinting over the next week or two?"

I'm thinking in terms of minimizing joint stiffness. 2. Regarding the referral to hand therapy, should we consider a baseline assessment *before* splinting to document the initial degree of extension lag and establish a benchmark for progress? Or is two weeks post-splinting sufficient for an initial evaluation? 3. Given the subungual hematoma, should we consider trephination for pressure relief? Or is it small enough to manage conservatively? 4. Finally, regarding the stack splint itself, do you have a preference for pre-fabricated splints or custom-"

Should we consider empiric treatment for *C. difficile* at this stage, or wait for the toxin assay results? Also, given the patient is on levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone known to carry a risk of *C. difficile*, should we consider switching the antibiotic for pneumonia if the patient is clinically stable enough?

I'm leaning towards waiting, as it seems like an extra step if the patient responds well to rehydration and the initial workup points towards a clear diagnosis. 2. You mentioned inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a possibility if the diarrhea persists. Given the acute onset of symptoms in close temporal relation to the antibiotic, wouldn't IBD be quite low on the differential? Are there any specific features in this case that make you consider IBD, even as a remote possibility? I'm primarily thinking of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis here.

Should we consider a neurological assessment, perhaps including monofilament testing and vibratory sensation testing, to assess for peripheral neuropathy?

Just to clarify my thinking regarding those less common diagnoses, if we *don't* see a definitive retroplacental hematoma on ultrasound, but the clinical picture remains highly suspicious for abruption (severe pain, bright red bleeding, fetal distress), would you still lean towards abruption as the most likely diagnosis, potentially a concealed or partially concealed abruption? Or would the absence of a visible hematoma significantly shift your thinking towards those less common possibilities like chorioangioma or uterine artery rupture? Also, in the case of a concealed abruption without a visible hematoma, are there any other sonographic findings, besides the ones we've already discussed (placental thickening, myometrial abnormalities, fetal distress), that might suggest a concealed hemorrhage?

Would you consider a short course of oral corticosteroids to help manage the acute pain and inflammation? Also, given the patient's report of leg weakness, albeit not objectively demonstrable yet, should we consider early referral to physical therapy to ensure proper body mechanics and prevent further injury while they're still experiencing significant pain?

I'm curious, given the migratory nature of the arthritis, the prominent knee involvement, and the relatively acute onset, how strongly are you considering rheumatoid arthritis at this point? Does the absence of other systemic symptoms like significant fatigue, weight loss, or morning stiffness (beyond the back stiffness which improves with activity) make RA less likely in your view? Would you also consider testing for ANA, given the eye involvement and family history of autoimmunity, even though the presentation isn't classic for lupus? Finally, regarding psoriatic arthritis, did you note any skin changes suggestive of psoriasis during the examination, or should I specifically look for those on the next visit?

I'm also curious about the slight leukocytosis. While not dramatically elevated, it's slightly above normal. Do you think this adds any weight to an inflammatory process, or could it be attributed to stress or other factors?

If the calprotectin is elevated, we'll proceed directly to colonoscopy with biopsies to evaluate for microscopic colitis. If the calprotectin is normal and the cholestyramine trial is unsuccessful, then pursuing a SeHCAT scan elsewhere might be warranted before colonoscopy. One more question \u2013 while less likely, could the mucus be explained by something like a proximal small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?

A pelvic ultrasound revealed a large right ovarian mass and significant ascites. This, combined with her early satiety, is concerning for ovarian malignancy. However, her CA-125 came back normal, which is somewhat unexpected. I also find it interesting that she denies any pelvic pain, which is often present, though not always, with ovarian masses. Her CBC was essentially unremarkable, showing no signs of infection or significant anemia. She denies any family history of gynecological cancers. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is ovarian cancer, despite the normal CA-125. Other possibilities, though less likely given the ultrasound findings, include a benign ovarian tumor (such as a cystadenoma or fibroma), a pelvic inflammatory process, or even a rare condition like Meigs syndrome"

Adding HE4, OVA1, and ROMA is a good idea for additional risk stratification, though as you said, they won't replace the need for histopathology. Given the significant ascites, I'm wondering if a paracentesis might be beneficial prior to the biopsy, both for symptom relief and for cytological analysis of the ascitic fluid. This could potentially provide additional evidence pointing towards malignancy. What are your thoughts on that? Also, while less likely given the size of the mass and the presence of ascites, we should still consider other, less common differentials. Could the normal CA-125 perhaps point towards a borderline ovarian tumor? These can present similarly, although typically with less ascites. A germ cell tumor is another possibility, though again, less likely given the overall clinical picture."

Given the patient's relatively young age (implied by her mentioning stairs at school), and while less common, could we consider a germ cell tumor, particularly a dysgerminoma, in the differential? While they often have elevated LDH, it's not always the case. Should we add an LDH test to the next round of bloodwork? Also, given the lack of pelvic pain, I'm still slightly hesitant to completely dismiss the possibility of Meigs syndrome, although the size of the mass and the degree of ascites seem atypical. Would you recommend any further imaging, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, to rule out pleural effusions and further evaluate for any other potential primary or metastatic disease, especially if the cytology from the ascites is suspicious?

One final question \u2013 while we've discussed borderline ovarian tumors and germ cell tumors, and while less likely, should we also consider a stromal tumor, like a fibroma or thecoma, in the differential, especially given the lack of typical ovarian cancer symptoms like pelvic pain?

Before we conclude, I have two final points. First, regarding the paracentesis, should we consider sending a sample for flow cytometry as well, given the possibility of a lymphoma, albeit a remote one? While the presentation isn't typical, the ascites and lack of other clear indicators could warrant this additional test. Second, given the patient's age and the mention of \"school,\""
