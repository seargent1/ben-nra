While less likely given the 2% concentration and the relatively typical presentation, I'd like to briefly consider the possibility of endogenous ochronosis, just to be absolutely thorough. Although the patient denies any unusual dietary habits or medication use, are there any specific questions I should ask to definitively rule out the endogenous form, or any specific lab tests you'd recommend? I'm thinking primarily about ruling out alkaptonuria, even though it's rare.

One final question: Given the patient's history of significant sun exposure, which likely contributed to the melasma in the first place, and considering the potential photosensitivity associated with retinoid and AHA use, what level of sun protection would you recommend during and after treatment for both the ochronosis and potential melasma recurrence?

The patient mentioned it was the reason she started using the hydroquinone cream. While the ochronosis is now the primary concern, I'm wondering if the initial diagnosis of melasma was accurate, or if perhaps the early stages of the ochronosis were misidentified as melasma. Is it possible the hydroquinone use exacerbated undiagnosed ochronosis, rather than being the sole cause? While less likely given the typical exogenous ochronosis presentation, could there be a component of both exogenous and endogenous ochronosis at play here? Perhaps a subtle underlying predisposition combined with the hydroquinone use? I understand this is venturing"

My primary concern, given the Brazilian freshwater exposure, is **schistosomiasis**. While the initial antibody test was ordered, I'm curious if it was specifically for *Schistosoma mansoni*, the species most prevalent in that region.

Less likely, but still needing consideration given the interstitial changes, are certain interstitial lung diseases like hypersensitivity pneumonitis or even an atypical infection. While the patient denies fevers, chills, and weight loss, these symptoms can be subtle or absent in some cases. My questions for you are: 1. What are your initial impressions based on the x-ray findings? 2. Would you recommend further imaging, such as a high-resolution CT scan of the chest? This could help better characterize the infiltr"

Given the absence of B symptoms (fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss), lymphoma seems less likely, but certainly can't be ruled out at this stage. Beyond the tests you've already suggested, I'd like to discuss a few additional points: 1. **Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy:** While the HRCT will provide more detail, a tissue diagnosis is ultimately necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Given the hilar adenopathy and interstitial infiltrates, a bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy seems like the most appropriate next step if the HRCT findings are suggestive of something like sarcoidosis or another granulomatous disease. 2. **Lymph node biopsy:** If the hilar adenopathy is prominent and accessible, an endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbron"

The Quantiferon Gold test is also important to consider, although the lack of constitutional symptoms makes active TB less likely. Given the patient's relatively young age (assuming from the lack of mention of other comorbidities) and the chronicity of the cough, I'm leaning towards sarcoidosis or a less common granulomatous disease as the most probable diagnoses. However, we must remain vigilant about other possibilities. I have a few further questions: 1. Should we consider fungal infections in the differential, given the interstitial pattern on the chest x-ray? Would you recommend a fungal serology panel at this stage, or should we wait for the bronchoscopy results? The patient hasn't mentioned any recent travel or exposure to specific environmental risks, but some endemic fungi can present insidiously."

If the bronchoscopy and initial cultures are negative, we can certainly pursue fungal serology and potentially even consider a surgical lung biopsy if the clinical picture warrants it. In addition to the already discussed tests, I'd like to propose adding a serum calcium level. Hypercalcemia, while not always present, can be a feature of sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases. It's a simple test that could provide further supporting evidence. Regarding the PFTs, do you have a preference for the type of testing \u2013 specifically, are you thinking full spirometry with lung volumes, or would spirometry alone suffice initially?

Firstly, given the atypical presentation with prominent skin findings, should we consider a skin biopsy specifically designed for immunophenotyping and molecular studies, in addition to the bone marrow biopsy? This might provide additional information about the lymphoma's characteristics and help rule out other cutaneous lymphomas definitively. Secondly, while the biopsy suggests B-cell origin, the lack of typical B symptoms (night sweats, significant lymphadenopathy) is somewhat unusual.

Regarding malignancy, while the CBC is normal, I'm wondering if we should consider a more targeted approach. Given the pleural effusions, would a cytology of the pleural fluid be helpful in evaluating for malignancy, even with a normal CBC? Or would you prefer to wait for the pericardial biopsy results before pursuing that avenue? The suggestion of a repeat echo with strain imaging is excellent. The initial echo didn't show any significant abnormalities, but perhaps strain imaging could reveal subtle myocardial dysfunction that was previously missed, which could explain the exertional dyspnea.

Perhaps the exam wasn't performed in a cold enough environment to elicit a response. I'll re-evaluate for Raynaud's at the next visit, paying closer attention to this. Given the greasy nature of the bumps, I'm leaning towards checking a lipid panel before pursuing a skin biopsy.

I'll also carefully assess for any telangiectasias, which could support a diagnosis of CREST syndrome, a limited form of scleroderma.

This patient presents with a four-year history of bilateral knee pain and limited extension following an injury while exiting an auto-rickshaw. Interestingly, the x-rays are normal. The patient describes the pain as an ache at the front of the knee, just above the patella, worsening with weight-bearing and prolonged walking. They also report clicking with stairs and some swelling, but no warmth or redness. The most peculiar symptom is the patient's description of a \"dip\" or \"soft spot\" above the patella, as if the muscle is missing. They also demonstrate limited active extension but good flexion. My initial differential includes patellar tendon rupture or tear, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and potentially even some sort of quadriceps tendonopathy or muscle atrophy, although the latter seems less likely given the mechanism of injury. The normal x-rays argue against any obvious bony pathology or osteoarthritis"

Just one final thought \u2013 while you've addressed the immediate risks, should we consider recommending the shingles vaccine (Shingrix) for the grandmother once she has recovered? Given this episode, she might be at higher risk for future recurrences, and vaccination could help prevent that. What's the recommended timeframe for Shingrix administration after an acute zoster episode?"

I'll also order a haptoglobin level. While the patient's symptoms initially seemed consistent with infectious mononucleosis, the development of jaundice and the lab findings showing hemolysis make me less inclined towards that diagnosis. Do you think the positive DAT, even with C3d predominance, could still point towards IM in the absence of other supporting serological evidence? Also, considering the timeline of the sore throat resolving *before* the onset of jaundice and anemia, does that make IM less likely in your opinion?

While the fungal infection explains the hoarseness and the white plaques, I'm wondering if it's the *only* issue at play. Could the fungal infection be superimposed on an underlying malignancy, masking it or perhaps even exacerbating the dysphagia? I'm particularly concerned about the persistent dysphagia.

Regarding the barium swallow, I'm wondering if a modified barium swallow study might be even more informative in this case.

I'll also ensure the pathologist is aware of the patient's history and our concerns, so they can pay particular attention to any subtle signs of dysplasia or malignancy. I appreciate your recommendation for the modified barium swallow. I think it will give us a much clearer picture of the swallowing mechanics and help determine if there's a functional component to the dysphagia.

While the initial presentation suggested HSV-2, the lack of positive HSV PCR or serology, coupled with the worsening of the ulcers despite antiretroviral therapy, makes me question that diagnosis. The biopsy findings, describing epidermal necrosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and a dense inflammatory infiltrate, are non-specific but raise the possibility of something more than just herpes. My primary differential now includes opportunistic infections, given his HIV status. The fact that the ulcers initially improved with ART and then recurred suggests a possible waning immune response or drug resistance, allowing an opportunistic infection to take hold. My top differentials at this point are: 1. **Syphilis:** While we don't have RPR results yet, the chronicity and ulcerative nature warrant strong consideration. The biopsy findings, while not diagnostic, are compatible with syphilis."

I'll add those to the list. We've already taken a biopsy, so we should have tissue available for fungal stains and mycobacterial cultures, if those haven't been done already. I'll check on the status of the RPR, bacterial/mycobacterial cultures, and fungal stains. While we wait for those results, I have a few more questions. Could the patient's HIV viral load of 450 copies/mL be considered adequately suppressed? I'm wondering if his partial response to ART, followed by recurrence of the ulcers, could point to suboptimal HIV control allowing for these opportunistic infections."

I'll contact the lab to ensure they're performing specific stains and cultures for mycobacteria and fungi, including *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, atypical mycobacteria, and deep fungal pathogens like Histoplasma. Given the location of the lesions, could we also be considering Donovanosis (granuloma inguinale)? While less common, it's still a possibility, especially with his compromised immune system. Should we add that to the differential and consider specific testing for *Klebsiella granulomatis*? Also, while the biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation, could we request a special stain for Donovan bodies on the existing biopsy specimen, or would a fresh biopsy be necessary for that?"

While less likely given the genital location, it's worth considering given his immunocompromised state. Regarding his ART regimen and adherence, I've confirmed he's on a first-line regimen of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Raltegravir, which he's been on for approximately two years. He reports good adherence, but I've ordered a medication reconciliation to verify and rule out any potential drug interactions or access issues.
