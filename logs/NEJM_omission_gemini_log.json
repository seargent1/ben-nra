My primary concern now shifts to management and ensuring the patient understands the chronicity of this condition. I've advised cessation of the hydroquinone cream, of course. My questions for you are: 1. What is your experience with the efficacy of various treatments for exogenous ochronosis, such as laser therapies (e.g., Q-switched ruby laser, Nd:YAG laser), chemical peels, and topical agents like tretinoin or ascorbic acid?

It could reveal the presence of other harmful ingredients like steroids or undisclosed higher concentrations of hydroquinone, which could inform public health initiatives and potentially help prevent similar cases. Furthermore, it could provide evidence for reporting the vendor to the appropriate authorities. Before we finalize the treatment plan, I have a couple of additional questions: 1.

Regarding the fatigue, I appreciate your suggestion for basic labs (CBC, CMP, TSH). I'll add those to the next order. While it's likely unrelated to the exogenous ochronosis, it's important to be thorough.

A pulmonologist has the expertise to diagnose and manage conditions like chronic bronchitis, asthma (cough-variant asthma can present without wheezing), interstitial lung disease, or other less common lung problems.

I agree with the ENT referral pathway if the initial investigations and antihistamine trial are unrevealing. The 24-hour pH monitoring for GERD is a good point, especially given the cough's chronicity. Even though the patient denies symptoms, silent GERD could be a culprit. Before we proceed, I'd like to revisit the possibility of environmental irritants, even though the patient reported no unusual exposures. Could the cough be related to something more common, like mold exposure in their apartment, or even just dry air, especially given the 6-month duration coinciding with potentially drier indoor air during the winter months (assuming we're currently in or near spring/summer)? Should we advise a trial of a humidifier at home, or consider allergy testing to explore sensitivities we might not be aware of? Also, while"

However, before we conclude, I wanted to touch on a couple of final considerations. First, given the 6-month duration, should we consider a chest CT scan if the chest x-ray is negative? While a chest x-ray is a good initial screening tool, a CT scan could potentially reveal more subtle abnormalities, such as interstitial lung disease or even early signs of malignancy, although the latter is much less likely given the patient's age and lack of other concerning symptoms. I understand we want to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure, but I'm wondering if the chronicity warrants a more"

While an ENT might be considered for a cough, the absence of postnasal drip, voice changes, or other ENT-related symptoms makes a pulmonologist the more likely and efficient referral."

While Atrophie Blanche can sometimes show mild perivascular inflammation, the presence of necrobiosis and granulomatous inflammation is not typical. My primary concern now is necrobiosis lipoidica (NL). The location on the shins, the brownish color, atrophy, and the histopathology strongly support this.

A couple of further thoughts: While the patient denies a history of diabetes, and we're checking fasting glucose and HbA1c, should we also consider a glucose tolerance test (GTT)? Sometimes NL can precede a diagnosis of diabetes by several years, and a GTT might pick up impaired glucose tolerance that a standard fasting glucose might miss. Secondly, regarding the lipid panel, are there specific lipid parameters you'd be most interested in seeing, or a standard lipid panel sufficient? Finally, while less likely, I'm still slightly curious about the possibility of a deep fungal infection mimicking NL, especially given the granulomatous inflammation.

My initial suspicion was Kaposi's Sarcoma given the skin findings, but the biopsy doesn't support that. The lack of lymphadenopathy is also unusual for most lymphomas. Given the intravascular nature of the lymphoma found in the biopsy, I'm wondering about intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL).

The initial presentation suggested heart failure with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and bloating. However, the chest x-ray revealed pericardial calcification and pleural effusions, shifting the focus to constrictive pericarditis. Surprisingly, both the echocardiogram and cardiac CT came back normal, ruling out the most obvious structural causes. Given the persistent symptoms and the negative cardiac workup so far, I'm wondering about a few less common possibilities. First, given the patient's description of not being able to take a full breath and the feeling of fullness, could we be dealing with a restrictive cardiomyopathy, even though the imaging didn't clearly show it? A cardiac MRI might be helpful to assess myocardial tissue characteristics and look for subtle signs of fibrosis or infiltration. Second, has the patient been tested for sleep apnea?"

While the patient denies dry eyes and mouth, the dysphagia and shortness of breath still make me slightly uneasy about possible pulmonary involvement, even in the absence of classic Sj\u00f6gren's-like symptoms. Could this be an atypical presentation of SSc with pulmonary involvement preceding or overshadowing sicca symptoms? Or should we consider other interstitial lung diseases in the differential, even though the overall picture seems strongly suggestive of SSc? Also, while we've discussed several antibody tests, I'm wondering about the sensitivity and specificity of these tests, particularly in the early stages of SSc. If the initial antibody panel comes back negative, but the clinical picture remains highly suspicious for S"

ESRD can cause a multitude of musculoskeletal issues, including joint pain, muscle weakness, and bone problems due to mineral imbalances and secondary hyperparathyroidism. A Nephrologist is best equipped to manage the patient's overall health, including the potential impact of ESRD on their knee issues. They can assess if the knee problems are related to electrolyte imbalances, renal osteodystrophy, or other complications of ESRD and dialysis.

While the initial injury after stepping off the rickshaw could have played a role, the progressive nature and bilateral presentation make me suspect something more systemic. The normal X-ray, CBC, and CMP are helpful in ruling out some immediate concerns like fractures, infections, or severe electrolyte imbalances. My primary concern is the possibility of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) leading to calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as calciphylaxis. Given the patient's ESRD and the fact that they're on dialysis, they're at high risk for SHPT.

Given the progressive nature of the weakness and the timeline coinciding with dialysis initiation, I think pursuing the CUA diagnosis is warranted even with the absence of prominent skin manifestations. A tissue biopsy, as you suggested, would be the definitive diagnostic step if the lab results don't provide a clear picture. Should we also consider other potential complications of ESRD that could contribute to muscle weakness, such as amyloid arthropathy or electrolyte imbalances despite the normal CMP?

While we're waiting for the lab results, should we consider a vascular assessment of the lower extremities? CUA can affect small and medium-sized vessels, and assessing blood flow to the legs might provide additional clues, even in the absence of overt skin changes. Something like an ankle-brachial index (ABI) or even a Doppler ultrasound could be informative. 2.

Could this be a combined effect of CUA and OA, or is it more likely that the clicking and popping are secondary to the muscle weakness and altered gait caused by the suspected CUA? Second, what is the typical progression of CUA in terms of muscle involvement? Does it tend to affect certain muscle groups more than others, or is the distribution generally symmetrical, as in this patient's case?

I'll pay particular attention to hip flexors and shoulder girdle muscles during the physical exam. Given that CUA muscle involvement doesn't typically favor extensors or flexors, the patient's predominant extensor weakness in the knees raises a couple of questions. Could this be related to the initial injury sustained when stepping off the rickshaw, with CUA exacerbating a pre-existing vulnerability? Or could the mechanics of altered gait due to CUA place disproportionate stress on the knee extensors, leading to a perceived weakness that's actually more of a functional limitation?

It also raises the possibility of something like phytophotodermatitis, though the history doesn't mention exposure to any plants. The four-month duration is also unusual for a simple contact dermatitis, but we can't rule it out entirely.

The patient denies any recent travel to endemic areas, exposure to unusual chemicals or toxins, or contact with birds. They report no gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rashes, or joint pain"

A bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsy has been on my mind, and I think it's warranted given the persistent symptoms and lack of a definitive diagnosis. This will allow us to directly visualize the airways, assess for any endobronchial lesions, and obtain tissue for histopathological examination and further microbiological studies, including fungal cultures.

However, given the initial suspicion of PSGN, we did test for streptococcal antibodies (ASO titer). Do you think it's worthwhile to also consider other infections, like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), given the hemolytic anemia and preceding illness? Could the sore throat have been a manifestation of one of these infections rather than a simple strep throat? Also, while the patient denies current swelling, should we consider subclinical glomerulonephritis contributing to the hematuria, even if it's not the primary driver of the patient's presentation?

The patient reports the dark urine started just a day ago, which seems like a rapid onset for significant hemolysis leading to jaundice. Could this suggest a more acute trigger, or is this timeframe consistent with the potential diagnoses we're considering, like cold agglutinin disease or PCH? Also, regarding the patient's poor appetite, could this be related to the underlying infection or the hemolytic process itself, or should we be considering other causes?

Most notably, the patient has a significantly elevated absolute eosinophil count. This, combined with the sterile pyuria, raises a red flag for me. My primary concern now is interstitial nephritis, possibly drug-induced, or less likely, a parasitic infection, although the patient denies recent international travel or freshwater swimming.

A urine cytology is an excellent suggestion given the macroscopic hematuria and will help rule out malignancy, which is still a concern despite the normal CT urogram. Given the eosinophilia, should we also consider ordering a serum IgE level? While parasitic infection seems less likely given the patient's history, a markedly elevated IgE could suggest an underlying allergic process, potentially contributing to the interstitial nephritis. Could the neighborhood pool be a source of chemical exposure, even if it's chlorinated?

What are your thoughts on that? Also, regarding the dysphagia, while it's currently localized and likely related to the fungal infection, could it also be subtly exacerbated by an underlying structural abnormality, perhaps related to his smoking history? While a barium swallow might be overkill initially, a flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) might provide more detailed information about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and identify any subtle dysfunction that might be contributing to his symptoms.

One more question \u2013 while the Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain is highly suggestive of a fungal infection, it doesn't definitively identify the *species*. Given his inhaler use, *Candida albicans* is certainly the most likely, but could other species, such as *Aspergillus*, be contributing, especially considering the hyperkeratosis? Should we consider additional staining or cultures from the initial biopsy sample, or perhaps from the repeat biopsy, to confirm the species and tailor the antifungal therapy if necessary? While fluconazole is generally effective against most Candida species, it might not be the optimal choice for other fungi. I'm also wondering if we should consider adding a topical antifungal agent, like nystatin suspension"

However, considering his significant smoking history and the hyperkeratosis, I'd like to be extra cautious. While unlikely, there's a small chance of a co-existing fungal infection with an early dysplastic or neoplastic process. Therefore, during the repeat laryngoscopy, in addition to the deeper biopsy, I plan to perform brush cytology of the affected area. This could provide additional information and potentially detect any atypical cells that might be missed on biopsy. Would you agree with this approach?
