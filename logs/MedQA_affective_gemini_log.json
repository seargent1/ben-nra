The fluctuating muscle weakness, particularly the diplopia worsening with activity and improving with rest, the ptosis, and the difficulty with stairs and upper limb use, all point towards MG. The normal CK levels, along with the EMG findings showing decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation, further support this. The normal chest CT scan rules out a thymoma, which is present in a subset of MG patients. However, I do have a couple of questions. First, while the patient reports diplopia improving when covering one eye, the description of \"seeing two of everything\" suggests binocular diplopia. I'd like to clarify the nature of the diplopia and ensure a proper ocular motility examination was performed to pinpoint the affected extraocular muscles.

Regarding the single fiber EMG, while the repetitive nerve stimulation study was positive, I agree that a single fiber EMG could be helpful if the ocular findings are inconclusive or if there are any other atypical features that arise. Do you have any recommendations for specific muscles to target with the single fiber EMG in this case, given the patient's symptoms of ptosis and generalized weakness?

While we're classifying this as generalized MG due to the limb weakness, it's on the milder end of the spectrum.

Before we conclude, I wanted to revisit the patient's reported cognitive changes. While subtle, they are concerning. Do you have any recommendations for specific neuropsychological testing beyond the MoCA, which might provide a more detailed assessment of cognitive function in PML? I'm particularly interested in tests that can differentiate between the cognitive deficits seen in PML and those potentially related to other conditions, such as depression or anxiety, which could be exacerbated by the diagnosis and the challenges of managing both Crohn's and PML."

She denies any radiation of the pain, swelling, or redness, but reports intermittent clicking with knee flexion. There's no history of previous knee injury. Ibuprofen hasn't provided significant relief. My initial differential includes: * **Medial Meniscus Tear:** The mechanism of injury (pivoting/twisting), location of pain, and clicking sensation are highly suggestive of this.

That's a good detail to check on re-examination. Did she mention anything about pain with activities that load the patellofemoral joint, like squatting or prolonged sitting?

Regarding the physical therapy, should we consider a period of relative rest or activity modification before initiating the exercises? I'm thinking of advising her to avoid pivoting and twisting activities, especially volleyball, for a couple of weeks to allow the initial inflammation to subside. Would you agree with that? Also, while quad strengthening and hamstring flexibility are important, should we also incorporate hip strengthening exercises into the PT plan?

Also, for the PT, what kind of patellar mobilization techniques do you recommend? Specifically, should we focus on medial-lateral glides, superior-inferior glides, or both? Finally, if we do proceed with an MRI after 4-6 weeks and it reveals a meniscal tear, what would be your preferred approach at that point \u2013 conservative management versus surgical intervention?

He denies any post-ictal confusion, headache, or other symptoms. His physical exam was unremarkable, including a negative Romberg test. ECG and blood glucose were normal. My initial impression is a vasovagal syncope, possibly a situational syncope triggered by micturition.

Focusing on the vasovagal/orthostatic differentiation, are there any other specific features in the history or any additional tests, besides the tilt table, that you think would be helpful in distinguishing between the two? For example, does the fact that it occurred immediately *after* urination, rather than during straining, make one diagnosis more likely than the other?

While we suspect vasovagal, the tilt table test will also help rule out orthostatic hypotension.

Given her difficulty breastfeeding, could engorgement or early mastitis be contributing to the fever? While she doesn't report localized breast pain or redness, it's worth considering, especially as it could co-exist with endometritis. Should we consider a breast exam as well? Her report of decreased flatus and bloating raises a flag for me. While ileus can be a normal part of the postpartum period, it's usually not this pronounced.

My primary concern is that while the anoscopy visualized hemorrhoids, it didn't necessarily exclude other pathologies co-existing. The initial DRE findings raise the possibility of a rectal mass being either the primary issue or perhaps prolapsing alongside the hemorrhoids, creating the impression of a single, irregular structure.

While a colonoscopy is the gold standard and will give us the most comprehensive view, I'm wondering if a sigmoidoscopy might be a reasonable interim step? It could potentially offer more information about the distal rectum and anal canal than the anoscopy, and perhaps clarify the nature of the palpable mass before the colonoscopy, especially if there are scheduling delays for the latter. It might also help guide the surgeon's assessment during the repeat DRE. Additionally, given the patient's age (55), while not significantly high risk, I'd like to add fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) to the workup. Even if the bleeding is ultimately attributed to hemorrhoids or a prolapse, it's prudent to screen for colorectal cancer given the patient'"

I agree that the surgeon's findings should guide the colonoscopy prep, particularly regarding the potential for obstruction. I'm still slightly apprehensive about the discrepancy between the anoscopy findings and the initial DRE. While internal hemorrhoids explain the bleeding, they don't fully account for the described irregularity of the mass. I'm wondering if the prolapsing hemorrhoids could be mimicking a more complex lesion, or if there's something else entirely that the anoscopy missed due to its limited scope. Therefore, in addition to the colonoscopy and repeat DRE, I'd like to suggest a pelvic MRI. This could provide a more detailed view of the rectal anatomy and surrounding tissues, potentially identifying any underlying masses, pelvic floor abnormalities contributing to a prolapse, or other"

I want to ensure we aren't overlooking a more sinister pathology simply because hemorrhoids are present. Therefore, I'd like to confirm with the surgeon whether the repeat DRE should be performed *before* or *after* the colonoscopy prep.

He's exhibiting some lethargy, particularly after vomiting episodes, but is still arousable and attempting to feed, though he vomits most of it back up. The vomit is greenish-yellow. The pregnancy and delivery were reportedly uncomplicated. My primary concern is a congenital intestinal obstruction, with Hirschsprung's disease high on the differential given the lack of meconium passage and the X-ray findings. I'm also considering meconium ileus, though the bilious vomiting makes it slightly less likely.

While a contrast enema will be helpful, should we also consider a rectal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis definitively? Also, given his age and the potential for rapid deterioration with a bowel obstruction, should we start him on IV fluids and consider nasogastric decompression?

No recent travel or unusual food intake. The patient has a cat but no other animal contacts. Fluid intake is suboptimal, around 20-24 oz today, though they can tolerate clear broth.

To answer your question about the pneumonia, I haven't reassessed the patient's lung status since the diarrhea started, focusing primarily on managing this acute issue. I'll definitely check on that at the next follow-up. It's a good point, as if the pneumonia isn't improving, it could suggest a more complicated picture.

Given the patient's age (which I haven't explicitly stated yet, but should obtain), I'm also wondering about microscopic colitis. While less common than *C. diff*, it can also present with watery diarrhea and cramping.

The patient describes the pain as a sharp, burning sensation, exacerbated by touch and dependent positioning. Importantly, the patient has type 2 diabetes, and reports chronically elevated blood glucose levels, along with peripheral edema in the ankles and feet, and visible varicose veins.

Her vital signs showing tachycardia and hypotension also point towards hemorrhagic shock. The fetal heart rate tracing with recurrent variable decelerations is also concerning and consistent with fetal distress in the context of a uterine rupture. My primary differential diagnosis is uterine rupture. However, we need to consider other possibilities, albeit less likely given the clinical picture. These include placental abruption, placenta previa, and vasa previa. While these can cause bleeding and pain, the patient's history of a C-section significantly increases the risk of uterine rupture, making it the most probable diagnosis. I have a few questions:"

I understand that visualizing the fetus outside the uterus isn't always possible even with a rupture, and I appreciate you confirming the lower likelihood of a ruptured abdominal wall vessel. Given the emergent situation, we prioritized rapid delivery and resuscitation. While we're proceeding with the emergency C-section under the presumptive diagnosis of uterine rupture, I'd like to revisit the differential diagnoses briefly for a thorough approach. Could the combination of placental abruption *and* a coincidental uterine window (dehiscence) at the previous C-section scar mimic the presentation of a complete uterine rupture? I acknowledge this is less probable than a frank rupture, but I want to ensure we've considered all possibilities, especially if intraoperative findings don't definitively confirm a complete rupture.

We have a migratory arthralgia starting with the left ankle, resolving, then affecting the right knee with significant effusion. The synovial fluid analysis clearly indicates inflammation. There are also accompanying symptoms of dysuria, fatigue, conjunctivitis, and anxiety. The negative STI testing, normal Reiter's panel, and normal HLA-B27 make reactive arthritis less likely, although the urinary symptoms are suggestive. The normal stool studies and IBD panel argue against enteropathic arthritis. Lyme disease is a consideration given the patient's outdoor activities, but we need to test for that specifically. My primary concern is the combination of migratory arthritis, conjunctivitis, and possible urethritis. While the tests for common infectious causes have been negative, I'm wondering if we should consider less common infections like *Mycoplasma* or *Chlamydia pneumoniae*.

While we're broadening the scope, have we considered sarcoidosis? Although less likely given the presentation, the fatigue, joint pain, and potential eye involvement could fit.

The location on the chest, while not the most common site, isn't unheard of for this subtype. The relatively slow growth over two months and the reddish-brown, scaly appearance might fit, although I acknowledge the absence of a more distinct macular component makes it less probable. I'm primarily raising this to ensure we've considered all possibilities before settling on superficial spreading by default. Regarding follow-up, I absolutely agree that regular skin exams are crucial. What frequency would you recommend for the first few years, considering the stage IB classification and negative sentinel node"

The negative hydrogen breath test makes carbohydrate malabsorption less likely, though it doesn't entirely rule out issues like fructose or lactose intolerance. My primary concern is the persistent mucus in the stool. While IBS can present with mucus, the chronicity and lack of other IBS-typical symptoms (like alternating constipation and diarrhea, bloating, significant pain relief with defecation) make it less likely.

Regarding your other suggestions, a celiac panel is a good idea. I hadn't considered that strongly given the lack of weight loss and other typical celiac symptoms, but it's certainly worth checking. I'll also add a TSH level to the next round of bloodwork. Hypothyroidism is a possibility, though again, the lack of other associated symptoms makes it lower on my differential.

Sometimes patients don't readily volunteer that information unless specifically prompted. Beyond medication review, I'm also going to delve a bit deeper into the patient's dietary habits. While they reported no specific food intolerances, I want to explore the possibility of a food sensitivity or even a dietary pattern that might be contributing. For example, excessive consumption of sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners can sometimes cause chronic diarrhea. I'll also ask about their fiber intake, as both too much or too little can disrupt bowel habits.

A gynecologic oncologist specializes in cancers of the female reproductive system and is the most qualified to evaluate, diagnose, and manage this patient's condition. Even if the mass turns out to be benign, the significant ascites and pleural effusion warrant the expertise of a specialist who can surgically manage complex pelvic masses.

Her symptoms started about a month ago with progressive shortness of breath and abdominal fullness. She denies any pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. She reports no significant weight changes but notes slightly irregular and heavier periods before they ceased a few months ago. The concerning findings are the right-sided pleural effusion, the large ovarian mass with significant ascites on ultrasound, and the progressive shortness of breath. While her CA-125 is normal, I'm still suspicious of ovarian cancer given the clinical picture. My primary differential diagnosis is ovarian cancer, possibly a low-grade serous or mucinous type given the normal CA-125. However, the pleural effusion raises the possibility of a metastatic process. Other differentials to consider include benign ovarian masses such as a cystadenoma or a"

The thoracentesis and paracentesis with cytology are also essential next steps, both for diagnostic purposes and to alleviate her shortness of breath and abdominal distension. Given the normal CA-125, could the ascites be caused by another process, perhaps related to a benign ovarian pathology, even in the presence of the mass? While less likely, could we be looking at a primary peritoneal malignancy rather than ovarian? Should we also consider Meigs' syndrome, although the lack of reported pain makes it less probable? Finally, what is your opinion on obtaining a biopsy of the ovarian mass itself at this stage, either via laparoscopy or laparotomy, versus proceeding with the fluid analysis first? I'm leaning towards the latter to minimize invasiveness initially, but I'm open to your perspective."

My main concern with delaying biopsy is the potential for disease progression, especially if we are dealing with a rapidly proliferative malignancy. While less likely given the normal CA-125, we can't entirely rule out a high-grade ovarian cancer or other aggressive malignancy. Therefore, how quickly can we realistically schedule the surgical exploration after the fluid analysis? Also, given the patient's age and the possibility of future fertility concerns, should we consider a fertility-sparing surgical approach if feasible and appropriate based on the final diagnosis? Finally, in preparation for the surgical exploration, should we order any additional imaging, such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis or MRI, to better characterize the mass and assess for any lymphadenopathy or other metastatic spread that"
