I believe this patient presents with Rosacea, likely subtype 3 (phymatoserosacea), given the bluish-brown discoloration on the central face, telangiectasia, skin thickening, and reported flushing triggered by sun and spicy food. The patient's report of a bumpy, leathery texture further strengthens this suspicion. However, the patient's use of over-the-counter hydroquinone for two years for presumed melasma, which hasn't improved the discoloration and may have worsened it, complicates the picture. My main concern is ruling out exogenous ochronosis, a potential side effect of long-term hydroquinone use, which can mimic some features of rosacea. The patient's description of bluish-brown discoloration aligns with this possibility. Additionally, the lack of response to the hydroquinone, and even potential worsening, raises a red flag.

I agree that a biopsy is crucial for differentiating between the two conditions and will schedule that for the patient. Given the potential for ochronosis, should we consider a Wood's lamp examination prior to the biopsy? Would that provide any additional information that might influence the biopsy site selection or interpretation? Also, considering the patient's family history of what she described as \"adult acne\" on her mother's nose, could this be relevant? While it could simply be rosacea in the family history, I'm wondering if it could also suggest a predisposition to developing ochronosis if the mother also used hydroquinone. Finally, are there any specific blood tests or other investigations you would recommend at this stage, beyond the CBC, ESR, and ANA which were already normal?"

Given that the patient reports flushing with sun and spicy foods, and considering the potential for misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment with the over-the-counter hydroquinone, if the biopsy rules out ochronosis, could we still be dealing with rosacea, even with the unusual pigmentation? Or are there other conditions, perhaps pigmentary disorders, that we should consider in the differential if the biopsy is negative for ochronosis? I'm thinking specifically about conditions like melasma, which the patient initially suspected she had, or even something like erythromelanosis follicularis faciei (EMF), given the potential for redness, follicular papules, and pigmentation.

My primary concern, given the patient's contact with street dogs and insect bites in Brazil, is visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly (though not explicitly mentioned, abdominal discomfort after eating could be an early sign) all fit the clinical picture.

Could we also consider testing for Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) given its prevalence in that region?

Beyond Chagas and the repeated Strongyloidiasis testing, given the prominent lymphadenopathy, I'd also like to consider testing for Toxoplasmosis, particularly given the potential exposure to street animals.

I'd prefer to reserve that for after the chest x-ray, CT scan, and spirometry, as those might give us a clearer direction. If those are unremarkable, then a trial of therapy would be a reasonable next step. Before we wrap up, I wanted to get your opinion on a couple of other things. First, given the 6-month duration, should we consider sarcoidosis, even though the patient doesn't have any other systemic symptoms? Should I add an ACE level to the blood work?

Regarding sarcoidosis, while the ACE level is a good screening tool, it's not highly specific. If it comes back elevated, would you recommend further investigation with a chest x-ray (already planned), and potentially a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, even if the initial CT scan is normal?

We have a month-long fever, a three-month history of evolving skin lesions progressing from macules to raised bumps and then ulcerating sores, along with fatigue and unintentional weight loss. The initial lab work, including CBC, CMP, HIV, RPR, and ANA, is unremarkable. My primary concern is the combination of persistent fever, skin lesions, and constitutional symptoms. The negative initial workup makes some of the more common infectious diseases less likely, though not impossible. The patient denies any recent travel, high-risk sexual behavior, IV drug use, or blood transfusions. They do garden in shorts and a t-shirt, which increases the possibility of vector-borne illness or environmental exposures.

Regarding the skin biopsy, should we target a lesion that is ulcerated, or would a non-ulcerated but raised lesion be more informative for histopathology? 2.

I agree that a right heart catheterization is the next logical step. Even with normal imaging, the hemodynamic data could reveal occult constrictive physiology, especially given the patient's symptoms and the calcification seen on the chest x-ray. Before we proceed with the catheterization, I have a few additional thoughts. First, I'd like to confirm the quality and timing of the imaging studies.

Regarding the imaging protocols, I'll confirm with the radiology department that the CT and MRI were optimized for constrictive pericarditis.

Could we be dealing with a very slow-growing, low-grade malignancy affecting the pericardium, perhaps a mesothelioma given the asbestos exposure, even though the biopsy was negative? While rare, it's a possibility we shouldn't completely dismiss. Are there any specific immunohistochemical stains or other specialized tests we could perform on the existing pericardial biopsy specimen, or would a repeat biopsy targeting a different area be more appropriate if we decide to pursue this line of investigation?

Also, are there any specific stains or immunohistochemical studies you'd recommend for the pathology lab to perform, given our differential?

The hepatitis panel and Monospot are also negative, making viral hepatitis and infectious mononucleosis less likely. The patient reports a recent sore throat treated with an unknown antibiotic about a week prior to the onset of these symptoms. This timeline raises suspicion for a drug-induced hemolytic anemia, possibly immune-mediated. The normal peripheral smear, while helpful, doesn't exclude this possibility. My primary concern is identifying the antibiotic the patient took. I've repeatedly asked them to check the packaging or contact the pharmacy, but they haven't been able to provide the name yet.

Regarding recent respiratory infections, the patient did report a sore throat and cold-like symptoms about a week before the onset of jaundice and dark urine. This coincided with the start of the antibiotic treatment. While we don't have evidence of a specific pathogen, the timing raises the question of whether a recent infection, in combination with the antibiotic, could have played a role in triggering the hemolytic anemia. Could certain infections predispose to this type of reaction? Also, while we suspect a drug-induced cause, the negative peripheral smear makes me wonder about other less common possibilities.

Also, given the patient's normal LFTs and CMP, are there any other less common causes of hemolytic anemia we should consider, even if they are less likely?

Regarding Schistosomiasis, while the travel history is negative, I suppose it's not entirely impossible. Did the eosinophilia resolve, or is it persistent? Also, were any other parasitic infections considered or tested for? Could the elevated eosinophils be related to an allergic reaction, perhaps to a new medication or food? He mentioned no new medications, but it's worth double-checking. Given the normal cystoscopy and cytology, I'm less inclined towards a urothelial malignancy at this point.

Second, I want to revisit the patient's medication history in more detail. While he initially denied new medications, it's worth specifically asking about any NSAID use, including over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen.

I'll also carefully review the CT scan myself for any subtle renal findings, though the initial read was unremarkable. A few more questions and thoughts: 1. **Regarding the 24-hour urine calcium:** While we await those results, should we also consider checking serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels? This could help us identify any underlying metabolic abnormalities contributing to potential hypercalciuria. 2. **Exercise-induced hematuria:** While the patient denied strenuous exercise, I'd like to clarify the type and intensity of his regular physical activity.

While exercise-induced hematuria is often benign and self-limited, I want to be thorough. Besides clarifying the intensity, I'll also ask about the timing of the hematuria in relation to exercise. Does it occur only after strenuous activity, or is it present regardless of physical exertion? This might help differentiate between exercise-induced hematuria and other causes. Regarding the renal biopsy, while I understand it's a valuable tool, I'm still hesitant to jump to it before exhausting all other less invasive options.
