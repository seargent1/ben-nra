I'm strongly leaning towards a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) given the constellation of symptoms and the positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The fluctuating diplopia, ptosis worsening with sustained upward gaze, proximal muscle weakness exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest, and the decremental response on EMG all fit the classic presentation. The absence of a thymoma on CT scan is also consistent, as only a minority of MG patients have thymic abnormalities. However, before finalizing the diagnosis and initiating treatment, I'd like to discuss a few points. First, while the EMG showed a decremental response, was single-fiber EMG performed? This test is more sensitive for MG, particularly in cases with mild or localized weakness. Second, were any other autoimmune antibodies tested, such as MuSK antibodies? While AChR antibodies are the most common, MuSK antibodies are present in a subset of seronegative MG patients"

MuSK antibodies were also not tested, and I'll add that to the list. The ice pack test is a good suggestion as well, and I can arrange for that to be done relatively easily. While I'm fairly confident in the MG diagnosis, are there any other conditions in the differential you think we should consider at this stage, even as less likely possibilities? Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) comes to mind, although the lack of autonomic symptoms and the presence of prominent ocular symptoms make it less probable. Could the fluctuating nature of the symptoms also suggest a mitochondrial myopathy, or is that less likely given the specific presentation and the positive AChR antibodies?

Does that influence the likelihood of any of these differentials, or bring any other conditions into consideration? Could you elaborate on why thyroid disease is on the differential? Is it the potential for muscle weakness and fatigue associated with thyroid dysfunction? I'll order thyroid function tests (TSH, Free T4) to explore that further. Regarding botulism, the patient hasn't reported any other symptoms suggestive of it, such as difficulty speaking, dry mouth, or blurred vision beyond the diplopia already discussed.

While botulism remains a general consideration in neuromuscular junction disorders, the absence of other autonomic symptoms makes it low on my list of priorities. Given that we've addressed the main differentials, I'd like to circle back to the single-fiber EMG and MuSK antibody testing. Would you recommend pursuing both of these before initiating any treatment for MG, or would you be comfortable starting symptomatic treatment while waiting for those results, given the strong clinical suspicion and positive AChR antibodies? I'm leaning towards the latter, as the patient is experiencing significant symptoms impacting their quality of life.

However, before we definitively conclude, I'd like to explore a few points.

Firstly, given his Crohn's and the reported persistent diarrhea, could a nutritional deficiency, specifically B12, be contributing to his neurological symptoms, even in the presence of likely PML? I've also ordered a B12 level to investigate this. Could the combination of PML and B12 deficiency explain the predominantly right-sided symptoms, or is that more typical of PML presentation?

He's fussy, refusing his bottle, and cries when his abdomen is palpated, particularly in the lower abdomen. Importantly, he seems to be gaining weight despite decreased intake. He's also having less frequent bowel movements. The mother hasn't reported any fever, lethargy, or change in urine output, but I haven't been able to get a clear answer on stool consistency or the presence of vomiting. An abdominal X-ray shows dilated bowel loops and absence of gas in the rectum, highly suggestive of an obstruction. His CBC is normal, ruling out infection or anemia at this point. My primary concern is a mechanical bowel obstruction. Given his age, intussusception, volvulus, or a less likely incarcerated hernia are at the top of my differential"

Should we consider a dedicated abdominal CT with contrast, or will the PET scan provide sufficient information in this regard? Also, while we're waiting for the results, I'd like to discuss the patient's smoking history. Could the combination of lymphoma and heavy smoking be contributing to his fatigue and weight loss?

Assuming the PET scan confirms widespread lymphadenopathy and the bone marrow biopsy is negative, which would further support a lymphoma diagnosis, what would be your initial approach to treatment for a suspected DLBCL in this patient, considering his age, smoking history, and B symptoms? Are there any specific chemotherapy regimens you would favor in this scenario, like R-CHOP? Secondly, while we suspect DLBCL, the possibility of Burkitt's lymphoma still lingers in my mind. If the IHC stains come back positive for MYC, along with CD10 and BCL6, and the EBV test is positive, how would that change your treatment approach? Would you consider a more intensive regimen like CODOX-M/IVAC in that"

The recent weight loss of 10 pounds in a couple of months, while positive for overall health, could also be contributing to increased stress on the patellar tendon. The normal X-ray rules out more serious structural issues. My main question for you is: Do you agree with the likely diagnosis of patellar tendinitis? If so, what would be your recommended course of treatment? I'm thinking conservative management initially, with rest, ice, NSAIDs, and potentially physical therapy focusing on eccentric strengthening exercises.

Perhaps reducing duration/intensity or switching to a lower impact activity like swimming or cycling temporarily to further offload the patellar tendon? 2. Should we consider recommending a patellar tendon strap or brace? Could this help alleviate pain and provide support during the initial phase of recovery? 3. Regarding the MRI, if we do reach that point, are there any specific sequences or protocols you'd recommend to best visualize the patellar tendon and surrounding structures? 4.

She reports uterine tenderness. My primary concern is postpartum endometritis. The prolonged labor, large baby, and vaginal delivery are all risk factors. The fever, lower abdominal pain, and abnormal lochia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, we need to consider other possibilities. Given the increased urinary frequency and uterine tenderness, a urinary tract infection (UTI) is also on the differential. Although she denies dysuria, UTIs can sometimes present atypically in the postpartum period. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is another, though less likely, possibility."

While BV and Trichomonas are less likely to cause the fever and lower abdominal pain, they could certainly contribute to the abnormal discharge and could complicate the clinical picture.

Given the prolapse, I was leaning towards recommending a conservative approach initially, focusing on increasing fiber intake, adequate hydration (which she reports is good), and possibly a topical corticosteroid and/or anesthetic cream. If symptoms don't improve within a few weeks with these measures, or if the prolapse worsens, then we can proceed with the colonoscopy. I also wanted to get your opinion on whether a referral to a colorectal surgeon would be beneficial at this point, or if we should manage conservatively and refer only if there is no improvement or worsening of the prolapse. Finally, given her history of five vaginal deliveries, should we consider pelvic floor dysfunction as a contributing factor to her straining and hemorrhoid development? Could this warrant a referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist in conjunction with the other recommendations?"

Should we prioritize obtaining her age to solidify the colonoscopy recommendation timeline, or would you be comfortable proceeding with the understanding that it's likely indicated regardless? Secondly, regarding the degree of prolapse \u2013 it was easily reducible on exam, but are there specific criteria or grading systems for internal hemorrhoids that would influence the urgency of surgical referral if conservative management fails?

These are all neurological symptoms. The doctor even orders an EEG (electroencephalogram), a test specifically used to assess brain activity and diagnose neurological conditions like seizures. The EEG results showing interictal spikes and sharp waves further solidify the need for a neurologist. The doctor's final assessment of \"focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe\" confirms that this is a neurological issue."

My main concerns now are the potential associated injuries. The patient reports near-constant numbness in the leg, which raises the possibility of sciatic nerve involvement.

Even without a fracture, the force required for this type of dislocation can cause labral tears and cartilage damage within the joint. Given the patient's persistent numbness, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a sciatic nerve stretch injury or even a partial transection, although the absence of bowel/bladder symptoms makes a complete transection less likely. Did the patient mention any specific location for the numbness? Knowing the distribution could help pinpoint the level of nerve involvement.

While the classic presentation of a posterior hip dislocation points towards sciatic involvement, the forces involved could potentially affect the femoral nerve too. A femoral nerve injury could also contribute to the difficulty moving the leg, though it wouldn't typically cause the \"heavy\" sensation.

However, the contrast enema surprisingly came back normal, making Hirschsprung's less likely. Meconium ileus was also a consideration, but the mother reports the amniotic fluid was clear. My primary concern remains a bowel obstruction, though the normal contrast enema is puzzling. I'm wondering if we might be dealing with a functional obstruction, such as meconium plug syndrome or small left colon syndrome.

Checking electrolytes, particularly potassium, is also important to screen for cystic fibrosis, especially given the meconium-related obstruction picture. I do have a couple of questions. First, given the baby is only two days old, how reliable would a contrast enema be in detecting a small left colon syndrome? I understand it can sometimes resolve spontaneously, but I'm wondering if it might be too early to definitively rule it in or out based on the enema alone. Second, are there any other functional obstructions we should be considering besides meconium plug and small left colon syndrome? Could this presentation be consistent with an ileus related to something other than meconium, perhaps a transient functional immaturity of the bowel? Finally, while we"

Before we proceed with the upper GI series and potential rectal biopsy, I have a few more questions: 1. Could the normal contrast enema potentially have pushed the meconium plug further down, temporarily relieving the obstruction and thus masking the true underlying issue, such as meconium plug syndrome or even Hirschsprung's? Should we consider a follow-up abdominal x-ray to assess for any changes in the bowel gas pattern before proceeding with the upper GI? 2.

While a subtle transition zone could have been missed, it seems less likely. Would a rectal suction biopsy be sufficient for diagnosis at this age, or is a full-thickness biopsy necessary? Also, what are the potential complications of a rectal biopsy in a neonate this young, and how can we minimize those risks?

This young man presents with a painful, swollen right ring finger following a football injury where his finger was caught in another player's jersey. He describes the pain as sharp and throbbing, rating it a 7-8/10 with movement, and a 4/10 at rest. He has limited range of motion at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, unable to make a fist, with the finger held in extension. There's localized swelling around the DIP joint with purplish discoloration and some redness at the fingertip. He reports a clicking/catching sensation with attempted flexion. Ice provides some relief for swelling but not pain. No other recent trauma and no known family history of arthritis. No known allergies. My primary differential diagnosis is a mallet finger, possibly with an associated avulsion fracture.

Would you recommend any other imaging, like an ultrasound, to assess the soft tissues, or would you prefer to wait for the x-ray results first? Also, while a volar splint is a good initial management strategy, should we consider early referral to a hand therapist for specialized splinting and range of motion exercises, depending on the x-ray findings?

While the lesion appears benign, surgical excision is the typical treatment for lipomas and sebaceous cysts, especially if they are growing, bothersome, or for definitive diagnosis. General surgeons are trained to perform these types of minor surgical procedures. While a dermatologist *could* potentially perform this removal, the location at the base of the skull makes a general surgeon more appropriate due to their familiarity with deeper tissues and potential proximity to vital structures. The diagnostic steps taken by the initial physician are appropriate, and the referral to a general surgeon for biopsy and potential excision is the logical next step."

The patient's history of worsening varicose veins, dependent edema, pain relieved by elevation, nocturnal throbbing, and the ulcer's appearance all point in that direction. The location of the ulcer is also typical, often occurring around the medial malleolus. However, given the patient's diabetes, Crohn's disease, and use of aspirin, we need to consider other possibilities and potential contributing factors. The normal CBC is reassuring, ruling out significant infection at this time, but doesn't exclude a localized infection within the ulcer itself. My main questions are: 1. Can you describe the ulcer's appearance in more detail? Specifically, its size, shape, depth, the presence of any granulation tissue, the characteristics of the surrounding skin (e.g., hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis,"

An ABI hasn't been performed yet, that's a good point. I'll arrange for that to be done as soon as possible. Given the patient's diabetes, I'm also concerned about the possibility of a neuropathic ulcer, although the pain description and location aren't as typical.

The classic triad of pain, bleeding, and uterine tenderness/irritability seems to fit this case. The sharp, tearing nature of the pain is particularly suggestive. Other possibilities, though less likely given the clinical picture, include: * **Uterine rupture:** While less common than abruption, the severe pain and cessation of contractions warrant consideration. However, the description of the pain as \"all over\" the abdomen, rather than localized, makes this less probable.

I'm leaning towards metronidazole for Giardia coverage, but I'm less certain about the best options for Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora. Would you consider nitazoxanide as a broad-spectrum choice? Also, while a flexible sigmoidoscopy seems appropriate if the initial workup is negative, should we consider proceeding directly to a colonoscopy?

Also, what duration of treatment would you suggest for each medication? Regarding the flexible sigmoidoscopy, if it reveals any signs of inflammation or other abnormalities, should we obtain biopsies during the procedure?

We have a young woman with a rapidly developing pleural effusion, ascites, and an ovarian mass, alongside shortness of breath and abdominal distension. While the CA-125 is normal, that doesn't rule out malignancy, especially in younger patients. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, but given the rapid accumulation of fluid and the relatively mild abdominal symptoms, I'm also considering other possibilities. My initial differential includes: * **Ovarian Cancer:** Despite the normal CA-125, the rapid progression and presence of ascites and pleural effusion raise strong suspicion. We need to consider epithelial ovarian cancer, but also less common types like germ cell tumors or sex cord-stromal tumors, especially given her age. * **Meigs Syndrome:** This is a triad of benign ovarian fibroma, ascites, and pleural effusion. It's less likely given the"

I was also thinking about the possibility of a **Tuberculous peritonitis**, although she doesn't have any constitutional symptoms like fever, night sweats, or weight loss that are typically associated with TB. Her relatively young age and the presence of ascites and pleural effusion make me want to at least consider it. Could we add a chest X-ray looking specifically for granulomas and potentially consider a peritoneal fluid analysis for AFB stain and culture? Also, given the normal CA-125, I'm wondering if this could be a **benign process mimicking a malignancy**. While Meigs syndrome is a possibility, the rapid onset is atypical. Could the mass be something like a **benign cystic teratoma** that has somehow ruptured or leaked, leading to the ascites and pleural effusion? The ultrasound report mentioned a \"large mass\" but"

This would give us better detail of the mass, including its size, composition (solid, cystic, mixed), and relationship to surrounding structures. It will also help assess the extent of the ascites and any lymphadenopathy. This information, combined with the biopsy, will be crucial for accurate staging if it does turn out to be malignant. While I understand a ruptured teratoma is less likely with a normal CA-125, I'd like to understand the ultrasound characteristics of the mass in more detail. Was it described as purely cystic, complex, or predominantly solid? Were there any specific features noted, such as calcifications or fat components, that might suggest a teratoma even with the normal CA-125?

I'll also schedule the patient for a paracentesis for both symptom relief and cytological analysis. Adding that to the expedited biopsy will give us multiple avenues for diagnosis. Given the rapid accumulation of fluid, I'm leaning towards a process that disrupts the peritoneal lining, either through inflammation or direct extension. While we're prioritizing malignancy, I want to circle back to the possibility of an unusual infectious or inflammatory process. Could we add a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level to the blood work? An elevated LDH could be seen in both malignancy and infection, but the SPEP could help identify any underlying gammopathies that might point towards a process like primary peritoneal carcinomatosis, which can present similarly to ovarian cancer.

Before we proceed, I want to clarify a few points based on your recommendations and my ongoing concerns: 1. **Regarding the biopsy:** Would you prefer a laparoscopic biopsy or a laparotomy, considering the significant ascites? I'm leaning towards laparoscopy for less morbidity, but I'm open to your thoughts given the potential need for more extensive exploration if we encounter unexpected findings. 2. **Paracentesis fluid analysis:** Beyond the cytology and AFB stain/culture, should we also send the fluid for a full chemistry panel, including glucose, protein, and LDH levels?
