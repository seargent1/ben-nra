The positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies significantly strengthen this suspicion. My primary concern at this point is confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of the disease. The Tensilon test, as I've requested, should be helpful in this regard. I'm particularly interested in your assessment of the patient's ocular and bulbar involvement, as these can significantly impact their quality of life.

Regarding pyridostigmine, I agree it's a reasonable first-line therapy if the Tensilon test is positive. However, given the patient's already significant ocular and bulbar involvement, I'm wondering if we should also consider a short course of corticosteroids, or even intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), if the Tensilon test confirms MG.

Given the potential for respiratory compromise, would you recommend performing pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including forced vital capacity as soon as possible, even before the Tensilon test? Or would you prefer to wait for the Tensilon test confirmation before proceeding with PFTs? Also, while we suspect MG, are there any other mimickers we should consider in the differential diagnosis, even with the positive AChR antibodies? I'm thinking specifically about Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), although the lack of autonomic symptoms makes it less likely.

Regarding the tick-borne illnesses, are there any specific regional considerations or travel history we should inquire about?

I agree that repeat thyroid testing is reasonable given the autoimmune predisposition in MG, even with the initial panel being normal. Sometimes these can fluctuate. Given that we're considering broadening the differential to include other autoimmune conditions, should we also consider testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF)? While the patient doesn't have any obvious joint symptoms, these tests could provide clues about a broader autoimmune process.

This 8-month-old male presents with a few days history of abdominal distension, decreased feeding, and increased fussiness, particularly with abdominal palpation. While he appears heavier to the mother, I haven't been able to obtain a recent weight myself. He seems to be constipated, with infrequent, likely hard stools. The abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel loops and an absence of rectal gas, raising suspicion for an obstruction. The contrast enema revealed a transition zone in the distal colon, highly suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. My main concern, given the clinical picture and the contrast enema findings, is Hirschsprung's disease. However, before we proceed with a rectal biopsy, I'd like to understand your thoughts on the case and if you agree with the likely diagnosis. Do you think the contrast enema findings are definitive enough, or would you recommend any further"

I appreciate you highlighting the possibility of ultrashort-segment Hirschsprung's and the need for a full-thickness biopsy; I'll make sure that's communicated clearly in the referral. Given the dilated bowel loops on the X-ray, how concerned are you about the possibility of enterocolitis at this point? Should we be considering any additional tests or interventions prior to the biopsy, such as serial abdominal exams or a repeat abdominal X-ray to monitor for progression?

Given the patient's age (not explicitly stated, but implied to be adult based on the context), Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most likely subtype, but we should also consider other possibilities like Follicular Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, and Burkitt Lymphoma, albeit less likely given the presentation so far.

I'm still curious about the discrepancy between the initial normal abdominal ultrasound and the subsequent CT findings of splenomegaly. Was the ultrasound technically adequate? Could the patient's body habitus have made visualization of the spleen difficult? I just want to be sure we haven't missed anything. Regarding the differential diagnosis, while DLBCL remains the most probable, the patient's relatively rapid onset of B symptoms and the degree of splenomegaly make me wonder about more aggressive subtypes, such as Burkitt lymphoma, even though other features might not be entirely classic.

Hopefully, with a heightened suspicion for splenomegaly, they'll be able to obtain better visualization this time. Beyond the ultrasound and MYC analysis, I have a few other thoughts. First, given the patient's occupation at a construction site, I'm still slightly concerned about potential exposures, even though he denied any specific incidents.

However, the normal CBC and CT scan findings are somewhat atypical for AIN. I was expecting to possibly see some renal enlargement or changes in the renal parenchyma on the CT. My main question is: Do you think the normal CT scan rules out AIN, or could it be a subclinical presentation? What other diagnoses are you considering given this clinical picture? Could the recent sinusitis and potential ongoing inflammatory process be contributing to these symptoms, even though the patient denies any other current illness?

X-ray is negative for fracture, dislocation, or effusion. The patient denies any prior knee injury and reports occasional clicking with knee flexion but no popping or grinding.

I'll initiate conservative management with NSAIDs, activity modification (reducing volleyball practice intensity and duration), and a referral to physical therapy for quad strengthening and patellar stabilization exercises. A couple of follow-up questions: 1. Should I consider a patellar stabilizing brace in addition to the PT referral? Would that be beneficial in the early stages, or should we wait to see how the patient responds to PT alone? 2. Regarding the corticosteroid injection for plica syndrome, are there any specific criteria you use to determine if and when it's appropriate?

Given your experience, if we assume for a moment that this is patellar tendinitis, are there any specific exercises or stretches you find particularly effective for this condition in volleyball players, beyond the general quad strengthening and patellar stabilization exercises? Volleyball involves a lot of jumping and landing, so I'm wondering if there are any specific considerations for that type of repetitive impact. Also, regarding the potential for a meniscus tear, even though it's less likely given the current presentation, should we consider an MRI sooner rather than later if the patient doesn't respond to conservative treatment within a certain timeframe, say 2-3 weeks?

He stated once or twice a night is typical for him. While this isn't excessive nocturia, it's still a relevant detail considering the timing of the event. Should we consider a bladder diary to better quantify his fluid intake and output? Given his age and the lack of other symptoms, while cardiac causes are lower on the differential, I still think it's prudent to rule them out. Would you recommend a cardiac workup beyond the ECG at this stage, such as an echocardiogram or ambulatory monitoring? I'm particularly wondering about arrhythmias, even though he didn't experience palpitations. Could this have been a very brief arrhythmic event?

Regarding the sleep study, should we order that concurrently with the Holter, or wait for the Holter results first? I'm leaning towards waiting, as a positive Holter might explain the syncope and obviate the need for a sleep study initially. However, if the patient reports significant daytime somnolence or other suggestive symptoms, I might consider ordering both simultaneously. One other question I had \u2013 given his age and the syncopal episode, even though it seems relatively benign, should we consider a carotid sinus massage in a controlled environment?

The physical exam (digital rectal exam) and subsequent tests (anoscopy) were also focused on the rectum and anus, areas within the purview of gastroenterology. Furthermore, the doctor discusses dietary modifications (fiber intake) as a first-line treatment, which falls within the scope of gastroenterological management.

I agree that a full colonoscopy combined with colorectal cancer screening makes the most sense, especially since it addresses the slight possibility of a missed diagnosis and takes care of screening in one go. Assuming the patient's age puts them in the screening guidelines, we can schedule that after the hemorrhoid treatment is complete. Just to clarify, would you typically wait a certain amount of time after a rubber band ligation procedure before performing a colonoscopy, or is it safe to do relatively soon after? Also, while I believe the patient's description of bright red blood is consistent with hemorrhoids, I'd like to revisit the patient's initial report of a palpable rectal mass. While the DRE revealed the prolapsing internal hemorrhoid, and the patient subsequently clarified they hadn't felt a mass themselves, is there a chance that something else could have been initially palpated, perhaps higher up in the rectum?

One final question \u2013 the patient described the bleeding as being \"mostly streaks on the toilet paper, sometimes a little mixed in.\" While this is often associated with hemorrhoids, could this bleeding pattern also be indicative of something else, perhaps a more distal source like an anal fissure? Should we consider examining for that specifically during the colonoscopy, or would you consider that unlikely given the absence of pain during bowel movements and the confirmed presence of the hemorrhoids?

Furthermore, the doctor discusses dietary modifications (fiber intake) as a first-line treatment, which falls within the scope of gastroenterological management.

Are there any specific factors in this case that make you feel it's particularly important, or is it just standard procedure in your view? Also, while the patient denies hitting their knees directly, they did describe their knees hurting immediately after the accident. If the knee X-rays are negative, would you recommend any further investigation of the knee pain, assuming it persists post-reduction? Perhaps an MRI later if needed?

Acetabular fractures, femoral head fractures, or something else? This might help me focus my attention when reviewing the images. 2. You mentioned an MRI if knee pain persists despite negative X-rays. Should we consider obtaining knee X-rays *after* the reduction as well as before?

I'm thinking along the lines of lumbar spine injuries, or even acetabular fractures extending into the pelvic ring, although the initial pelvic X-rays were negative. Should we consider a lumbar spine X-ray or repeat pelvic imaging if the patient continues to experience pain in those areas after the hip reduction?

He describes the pain as sharp and throbbing, rating it 7-8/10. There's localized swelling around the DIP, with some purplish discoloration distally, but no subungual hematoma. He has limited range of motion at the DIP, reporting an inability to flex the joint, and some stiffness and pain with PIP flexion. X-rays were negative for fracture or dislocation. My initial impression is a soft tissue injury to the DIP, most likely a dorsal capsule sprain or a mallet finger injury, given the mechanism of injury and inability to flex the distal phalanx. However, a volar plate injury or even a central slip injury could also be considered given the hyperextension mechanism and pain with PIP flexion. My questions for you are"

That would certainly help visualize the extensor tendon and assess for a partial or complete tear, confirming or ruling out a mallet finger. It could also help evaluate the volar plate. Would you recommend a dynamic ultrasound to assess for joint stability/laxity, or would static imaging suffice in this case? Also, given the purplish discoloration near the fingertip, although there's no subungual hematoma, should we be concerned about a possible nail bed injury or avulsion fracture that might not be visible on plain radiographs?

While the patient denies polydipsia, polyphagia, or polyuria, I'd like to explore that further. Could we run a HbA1c to get a better picture of their long-term glucose control? PG can be associated with underlying systemic diseases, including diabetes, and we need to rule that out definitively. Second, while the patient denies a family history of autoimmune conditions, PG is often linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other immune-mediated disorders.

False positives can occur, and inducing another lesion seems unnecessarily burdensome for the patient at this stage. I'm leaning towards initiating treatment for PG and monitoring the response. If it proves refractory, then we can reconsider the pathergy test. Given the patient's age and the relatively acute onset, I'm also wondering about any potential drug triggers. While they didn't report taking any new medications, it's worth revisiting that line of questioning, perhaps with a more detailed medication history including over-the-counter drugs and any recent antibiotic use.

However, a peripheral blood smear and perhaps a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) could be considered to further investigate this avenue, especially if the PG proves difficult to manage. Before jumping to malignancy, I'd like to prioritize exploring the more common associations. I'm particularly interested in the potential link with IBD, given the absence of other clear triggers. Even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, subclinical IBD can manifest with extraintestinal findings like PG. Therefore, in addition to the fecal calprotectin, I'd advocate for a consultation with gastroenterology for further evaluation. They might consider a colonoscopy if"

Starting with fecal calprotectin and the gastroenterology consult makes sense. However, a full colonoscopy might be a bit invasive initially, especially if the calprotectin comes back negative. Perhaps we could consider a trial of systemic corticosteroids first and see how the PG responds. If there's significant improvement, it might suggest a less aggressive or subclinical form of IBD, and we could then proceed with less invasive investigations like a fecal occult blood test or even just close monitoring for gastrointestinal symptoms.

Given the potential for rapid deterioration with placental abruption, having the OR team ready is crucial. I'm still slightly concerned about the possibility of uterine rupture, even though it's less likely. Did the notes from her previous C-section mention the uterine incision type? Knowing if it was a low transverse or classical incision would significantly impact the risk. Even with a low transverse incision, there's still a small risk, especially considering the severity of her pain. While we wait for her arrival at St. Luke's, could we access her recent ultrasound report? Knowing the placental location would definitively rule out previa and also provide information about placental abnormalities that might predispose to abruption, such as a retroplacental hematoma, even if it wasn't apparent two weeks ago.

While she describes it as constant and sharp, which leans towards abruption, the fact that it worsens with deep breaths makes me wonder about other potential contributing factors. Could this be a sign of referred pain, perhaps from a concealed abruption irritating the diaphragm? Or could there be a concomitant pulmonary issue, although she denies shortness of breath? I'm also curious about the slight decrease in bleeding she reported, followed by a statement that it hadn't slowed down. This inconsistency makes me wonder about the reliability of her assessment given the stressful situation. While we're waiting for further information, should we consider other,"

Specifically, I'm interested in her vital signs (especially blood pressure and heart rate), fetal heart rate tracing, and any initial exam findings regarding uterine tone and localized tenderness.

However, the negative PCR throws a wrench in that theory. My primary concern remains the patient's vision. Given the negative CMV PCR, what are your thoughts on other potential diagnoses that could explain the retinal findings?

A toxoplasmosis serology was not performed initially, as CMV retinitis seemed the most likely culprit given the clinical picture. I'll order that test right away. While syphilis is a possibility, the patient hasn't reported any neurological symptoms, and the retinal findings aren't typical for syphilitic retinitis. However, given his immunocompromised state, we can't rule it out completely. A syphilis test should also be added to the workup. Regarding PORN, I'm slightly less inclined towards that diagnosis, as it typically presents with more rapid vision loss and often involves retinal necrosis, which wasn't clearly observed in the initial fundoscopy. However, with his low CD4 count, it remains a possibility. Fungal infections like candidiasis are also a good consideration."

Given the patient's stable weight and lack of systemic symptoms, disseminated fungal infection seems less likely, but with such a low CD4 count, I want to be thorough. Also, while we await the biopsy results, should we start the patient on any empiric treatment? I'm hesitant to initiate broad-spectrum antivirals without a clearer direction, but the patient's vision is at risk.

Should we also consider adding empiric treatment for syphilis, given the patient's immunocompromised state, even though he lacks neurological symptoms? While it's less likely, the potential consequences of untreated neurosyphilis are severe. Would a lumbar puncture be beneficial at this stage, or should we wait for the syphilis serology results first? Secondly, regarding the skin biopsy, should we request special stains and cultures"

This is a puzzling case of acute inflammatory monoarthritis of the right knee with accompanying urinary symptoms and conjunctivitis, developing over a few weeks. The negative Lyme and HLA-B27 results make reactive arthritis and Lyme disease less likely, though not impossible given the limitations of testing in early stages. The normal Chlamydia and Gonorrhea NAAT also argues against a directly infectious cause of the arthritis, though again, it doesn't completely rule out a preceding infection triggering a reactive process. My primary concern is the possibility of a disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), even with the negative urine NAAT. DGI can present with arthritis-dermatitis syndrome and doesn't always show up on initial urine tests.

Could we ask the patient specifically about any episodes of diarrhea, abdominal cramping, or any change in the color or odor of their urine in the past few months?

Could the ascites be due to something other than malignancy, like Meigs' syndrome, even though she doesn't report a fibroma specifically? Or perhaps a benign process causing a reactive effusion?

A CT abdomen/pelvis might be helpful for surgical planning if the mass is malignant, but I'm hesitant to add radiation exposure unnecessarily, especially if she's young. What are your thoughts?
