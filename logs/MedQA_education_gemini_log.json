I strongly suspect myasthenia gravis (MG) given the constellation of symptoms: fluctuating proximal muscle weakness, diplopia worsening with lateral gaze, ptosis, and positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The patient's symptoms are exacerbated by exertion and improve with rest, which is classic for MG. The difficulty chewing and the dyspnea on exertion further support this diagnosis. The absence of sensory symptoms, normal reflexes, and normal bowel/bladder function also point away from other neuromuscular disorders. However, before we definitively conclude, I'd like to discuss a few points and potential differentials. While the AChR antibodies are highly suggestive, I'd like to know if the titer level was significantly elevated. Could we also test for MuSK antibodies? Although less common, MuSK-positive MG can present similarly. Secondly, while the chest CT ruled out a thymoma, which is important in MG, could we consider"

Single fiber EMG is a good suggestion as well, especially if the serological tests are less definitive. I'll order those tests right away. Regarding LEMS, while I agree it's less likely given the predominantly proximal weakness and the absence of autonomic symptoms typically seen in LEMS (like dry mouth or erectile dysfunction), testing for voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies is a reasonable precaution to definitively rule it out. Did the patient report any improvement in strength with repeated muscle use? That would be a more characteristic finding in LEMS, as opposed to the worsening with exertion seen in MG.

We should screen for common co-occurring conditions like thyroid disease (with TSH and free T4 levels), rheumatoid arthritis (with a rheumatoid factor), and lupus (with an ANA). To your question about recent infections, she denied any recent illnesses in the initial history, but I'll specifically ask about respiratory infections in the past few months, as these can sometimes trigger or exacerbate MG.

I'm leaning towards a single-stage if possible to minimize the overall surgical burden on such a young infant. Second, while the contrast enema is highly suggestive, have you considered a rectal biopsy to definitively confirm the absence of ganglion cells before proceeding to surgery? I understand it's often deferred in favor of intraoperative biopsies these days, but I wanted to get your preference in this specific case. Finally, regarding the lower GI series, should we add anything specific to the standard protocol, given the patient's age and presentation?"

While a negative bacterial culture argues against a typical bacterial infection, it doesn't exclude AIN. The rash the patient experienced with amoxicillin also raises the possibility of a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. My primary differential diagnosis is drug-induced AIN. However, I'd like to explore other possibilities. Could this be an atypical pyelonephritis despite the negative culture?

Given the patient's initial presentation with sinusitis, could a viral cause, perhaps one that wasn't fully eradicated and now causing these renal manifestations, be a possibility? While the CBC was normal, could this still be an early presentation of a more serious systemic illness like vasculitis, even though we don't have other strong indicators at this point?

Could the AIN, if present, be exacerbating the pre-existing hypertension managed by the lisinopril, or could the lisinopril itself be contributing to the renal picture despite being on it chronically?

I haven't measured her Q angle yet, but I will do so at the next appointment. A larger Q angle could certainly predispose her to PFPS, especially given the increased activity and repetitive stress from volleyball. Given the acute onset related to a specific activity involving twisting and pivoting, and the catching sensation, medial plica syndrome seems the most likely at this point. However, the pain with weight-bearing and going up and down stairs also points towards PFPS. Would you recommend starting with conservative management for now, such as rest, ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy focusing on strengthening the vastus medialis and stretching tight hamstrings and IT band?

Given the catching sensation, should we consider an intra-articular corticosteroid injection if the pain doesn't respond adequately to the initial conservative measures within, say, 2 weeks? Or would you prefer to wait for the full 4-6 weeks before considering that option? 2. Regarding the physical therapy, should we prioritize exercises that address patellar tracking issues, or would a more general knee strengthening and flexibility program be sufficient initially?

One final question: Given the negative McMurray's test and the lack of other symptoms suggestive of a meniscal tear, how concerned should we be about the possibility of a subtle meniscal injury that might not be clinically apparent yet? While medial plica syndrome and PFPS seem most likely, could a minor meniscal tear still be contributing to the pain, especially with the twisting mechanism of injury?

The patient experienced a sudden, brief loss of consciousness after using the restroom, with no prodrome other than the reported occasional lightheadedness upon standing. He denies any chest pain, palpitations, or other cardiac symptoms. The ECG was normal, and initial blood work showed normal glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes. He reports moderate exercise with regular walks and no concerning family history. The fact that he locks the bathroom door raises the possibility of a slightly delayed discovery and perhaps a longer period of unconsciousness than initially reported by his wife. However, the persistently missing CBC and urinalysis are problematic. While I believe a vasovagal episode is the most likely explanation, we need to rule out other causes, including anemia, infection, or a metabolic issue. I'm particularly"

I haven't formally assessed for orthostatic hypotension with measurements, but the patient's report of occasional lightheadedness on standing raises that possibility, and it could certainly contribute to a vasovagal episode in this context. I'll perform orthostatic vitals to quantify that. My main concern remains the lack of CBC and urinalysis results. I've personally contacted the lab twice now, and they've promised to expedite the processing. Should we consider proceeding with the tilt table test even before those results are in, given the strong clinical suspicion for vasovagal syncope? Or would you prefer to wait? I'm also wondering if we should consider a 24-hour Holter monitor to rule out any underlying arrhythmias, even though the resting ECG was normal. What are your thoughts on that?"

The lack of audible swallowing during feeds and the mother's uncertainty about the number of wet diapers strongly suggest the infant isn't getting enough milk. While the normal CBC, blood culture, and urinalysis are reassuring in ruling out some immediate infections, they don't address the core issue of feeding difficulties. The mother's lack of prenatal care makes it difficult to ascertain any underlying maternal or fetal conditions that might contribute to this.

Could we try to get more details about the discharge \u2013 color, consistency, odor, frequency \u2013 before proceeding with the more invasive tests? This might help us refine the pretest probability for congenital infections. Also, while a TORCH screen is broad, are there any specific infections within that panel you're most suspicious of given the current presentation? Finally, regarding the lumbar puncture, are there any specific CSF findings we should be looking for beyond the usual cell counts and cultures, such as specific IgM antibodies or PCR for certain pathogens? I want to ensure"

My primary concern is postpartum endometritis. Her fever of 101\u00b0F, chills, and night sweats point towards an infectious process. The lower abdominal tenderness localized to the uterus, along with the abnormal vaginal discharge, further strengthens this suspicion. The prolonged labor and large infant are both risk factors for endometritis. However, given the sluggish bowels and frequent urination without dysuria, I'd like to consider other possibilities in the differential diagnosis. These include: * **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** While she denies dysuria, the frequent urination could still suggest a UTI. The sluggish bowels could be secondary to the overall systemic illness. * **Constipation:** The sluggish bowels could be contributing"

If the ultrasound shows evidence of thrombus, that would certainly shift the diagnosis towards septic pelvic thrombophlebitis.

While the patient hasn't reported any prominent autonomic features besides the aura, the \"dirt-like\" taste itself could be considered an autonomic manifestation. However, the lack of other autonomic symptoms like vomiting, pallor, or changes in heart rate makes it less likely. I agree that the seizure duration is consistent with Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Given the atypical aura and the \"spacing out\" episodes, I'm still leaning towards temporal lobe epilepsy as the primary diagnosis. Before we proceed with treatment, I want to ensure we've explored all avenues. The developmental and cognitive assessment is an excellent suggestion. I'll arrange for that.

A rectal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. My main concern now is the level of the aganglionic segment. While the classic presentation suggests a rectosigmoid involvement, we need to consider the possibility of total colonic aganglionosis given the complete absence of any stool passage whatsoever.

Given his young age and the possibility of total colonic aganglionosis, would you consider a full-thickness rectal biopsy at a higher level (e.g., 2-3 cm above the dentate line) to be helpful in this case, or do you feel confident that intraoperative frozen sections will provide sufficient information for decision-making? Also, regarding the leveling ostomy, would you prefer a loop colostomy or an end colostomy in this scenario?

One more question regarding the surgical approach. While I understand the preference for an open procedure in neonates, given the potential for extensive resection if we're dealing with total colonic aganglionosis, have you considered a staged approach with a laparoscopic-assisted initial exploration to assess the extent of the aganglionosis, followed by a decision on open versus laparoscopic pull-through at a later stage? This might help minimize the initial surgical insult, especially if a significant portion of the colon needs to be resected.

We will then create a divided loop colostomy. Post-operatively, we'll initiate Ampicillin and Gentamicin. Now, a few final points for clarification: 1. **Regarding the staged approach:** If the laparoscopic exploration reveals total colonic aganglionosis, would you prefer to proceed with the pull-through procedure during the same operation, or would you prefer to stage the pull-through to a later date after the infant has recovered from the initial exploration and colostomy creation? 2. **Transition zone confirmation:** While I understand and agree with the use of intraoperative frozen sections"

Are we looking at weeks, months, or is it more dependent on weight gain and overall clinical status? 2. **Nutritional management:** Given that the mother is breastfeeding, do you have any specific recommendations for her during the perioperative period and while the infant has a colostomy? Should she continue breastfeeding, or would you recommend switching to a specialized formula designed for infants with intestinal issues?

We have a patient presenting with pain and swelling in the right ring finger DIP joint, two days post-injury during a football game where the finger was caught and yanked. He describes the pain as sharp, localized to the DIP, rating it a 7/10. The swelling is also localized to the DIP. He has limited ROM, particularly flexion at the DIP, and notes bruising and purplish discoloration. He denies any numbness or tingling. An x-ray was negative for fracture or dislocation. He's been taking ibuprofen with minimal relief. My initial thoughts are that this is most likely a mallet finger, possibly with a volar plate injury or even an avulsion fracture that wasn't visible on the initial x-ray.

It could potentially expedite diagnosis and guide management, especially if there's concern for instability. Also, what are your thoughts on the potential benefit of early referral to hand therapy? Even with splinting, early mobilization protocols under the guidance of a therapist might optimize functional recovery.

A branchial cleft cyst is a good addition to the differential, although, as you mentioned, the location at the midline base of the skull is less typical. I will ensure the radiologist is aware of this possibility when interpreting the MRI. I agree that cystic metastasis or sarcoma are less likely given the lack of other symptoms and the patient's overall good health. However, I appreciate you mentioning them to ensure we maintain a broad differential. Given the rapid growth, the somewhat unusual location, and the now broader differential including possibilities like branchial cleft cyst, encephalocele, and even the less likely malignant cystic lesions, I'm leaning towards obtaining a surgical consult as well. While we await the MRI results, having a surgical opinion lined up might expedite any necessary intervention, especially if the MRI findings are concerning. Would you concur with obtaining a surgical consult at this stage, or would you prefer to wait for the MRI"

This location is significant because it's where the thyroid gland resides. While the ultrasound suggests a cyst and the doctor suspects a lipoma or sebaceous cyst, thyroid nodules and other thyroid issues can also present as neck swellings. An endocrinologist specializes in the endocrine system, which includes the thyroid gland, and is best equipped to definitively diagnose and manage any potential thyroid-related issues. Even if the aspiration confirms a benign cyst, an endocrinologist can still rule out any underlying thyroid involvement and provide appropriate follow-up care."

The surrounding skin does show some erythema, but not extensive, and there's minimal induration. The patient's report of bilateral lower leg swelling, worsening throughout the day, makes me wonder about the contribution of venous insufficiency. Could the ulcer be a mixed picture, perhaps starting as an insect bite that then ulcerated due to underlying venous stasis and became secondarily inflamed? The mesalamine use certainly points towards the possibility of pyoderma gangrenosum, but the lack of significant surrounding induration and the presence of the bilateral leg swelling makes me hesitate to jump to that conclusion without the biopsy. Should we consider a venous Doppler ultrasound of the legs to assess venous function? Also, given the patient's diabetes, could we be looking at a neuropathic ulcer, even though the pain is quite significant? I'd like"

Given the patient's diabetes, even though a neuropathic ulcer is less likely with the significant pain, should we also check an HbA1c to assess their glycemic control? Poorly controlled diabetes could certainly impair wound healing and contribute to the ulcer's chronicity, regardless of the primary cause. While pyoderma gangrenosum remains high on the differential, I'm still concerned about the bilateral leg swelling. If the Doppler reveals significant venous insufficiency, how would we manage this concurrently with treating the ulcer itself?

Could any of these medications exacerbate an existing ulcer or contribute to delayed healing? I'm particularly thinking about the aspirin, given its antiplatelet effects. Also, while we're waiting for the biopsy results, are there any topical treatments we could consider for pain relief or to promote a clean wound environment?

Assuming the biopsy confirms PG, what would be the first-line systemic treatment approach?

This 38-week pregnant patient presents with acute onset vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and concerning fetal heart rate decelerations \u2013 recurrent variable decelerations to be precise. The sudden cessation of contractions after the onset of bleeding, coupled with her pain description, immediately raises suspicion for placental abruption. Her prior C-section also increases her risk. Given her decreased hemoglobin, though not drastically low, I'm concerned about ongoing blood loss. While her platelets and coagulation studies are currently normal, we need to be vigilant for potential DIC, especially if the abruption is severe. My primary differential diagnosis is placental abruption. However, we should also consider other possibilities, such as: * **Uterine rupture:** Given her prior C-section, this is a serious concern, although the pain description is perhaps more typical of an abruption.

It's a good point about the Kleihauer-Betke test \u2013 I'll add that to the orders for when she arrives at the hospital.

While I understand it adds another procedure, it could be helpful in differentiating CMV retinitis from other retinal pathologies, particularly PORN, and could also help assess the extent of retinal involvement in the case of CMV. 2. **Regarding treatment initiation:** Assuming the funduscopy supports a presumptive diagnosis of CMV retinitis, would you initiate induction therapy with intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir?

The patient also reports burning with urination and recent conjunctivitis. While the CRP and HLA-B27 are normal, I'm still suspicious given the clinical picture. The elevated WBC and ESR further support an inflammatory process.

While I understand it's a potential option, I'm hesitant given its significant side effect profile and the availability of newer, potentially more effective therapies. Could you elaborate on your current preference regarding interferon versus targeted therapy or immunotherapy in this context? Specifically, if the patient is BRAF positive, would you favor targeted therapy as a first-line adjuvant treatment over immunotherapy, or vice versa? And if BRAF negative, what immunotherapy regimen would you consider most appropriate? Also, are there any specific clinical"

We have a patient presenting with a concerning constellation of symptoms: increasing abdominal girth, shortness of breath, and a large ovarian mass confirmed on ultrasound. She also has significant ascites. While her CA-125 is normal, that doesn't rule out malignancy, especially considering the other findings. Her CBC is unremarkable, and her CMP is normal. She reports increased fatigue but denies weight changes, pain, GI symptoms, or abnormal vaginal bleeding. She has no personal history of gynecologic issues but we haven't fully explored her family history yet. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, given the ascites and the size of the mass. However, the normal CA-125 and lack of other classic symptoms make me wonder about other possibilities. Could this be a benign ovarian tumor, like a fibroma or a cystadenoma, that's large enough to cause these symptoms?"

Could the ascites be explained by that? 2. The patient hasn't reported any acute pain, which makes me wonder about the likelihood of torsion. Is it possible to have a slow, chronic torsion that presents with ascites and shortness of breath without significant pain? Or are there other mechanisms by which a benign tumor could cause this much ascites? 3. Regarding Meigs' syndrome, the patient's CBC doesn't show anemia, which I understand is a common component.

Are there any specific tumor markers or other tests we could consider that might help differentiate between a benign process causing this level of ascites versus a malignant one, even with a normal CA-125?
