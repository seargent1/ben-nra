My main concern now shifts to management and mitigating further damage. I'd like to get your opinion on a few things: 1. Given the patient acquired the hydroquinone cream over-the-counter, do you think this highlights a need for stricter regulations on the sale of such products, especially higher concentrations? This seems like a preventable case. 2. The patient is concerned about the cosmetic appearance. What treatment modalities do you find most effective for exogenous ochronosis in your experience? I'm considering topical agents like tretinoin and/or chemical peels, but I'm also curious about your experience with laser therapies like Q-switched ruby or Nd:YAG lasers"

While I understand it can be effective in some cases of exogenous ochronosis, I'm worried about exacerbating the pigmentation or causing further skin damage. Do you think the benefits outweigh the risks in this case, or would we be better off focusing on tretinoin, chemical peels, and laser therapy alone? Unfortunately, the patient doesn't recall the exact concentration of hydroquinone in the cream and purchased it over-the-counter. She's bringing it to the next appointment, so I'll be able to confirm then. Given the severity of the discoloration, I suspect it was likely a higher concentration, potentially purchased outside of regulated channels.

What peel concentration and frequency do you recommend starting with? I'm leaning towards glycolic acid peels, given their generally good tolerability, but I'm open to suggestions. Should we start with a superficial peel and increase the concentration as tolerated, or would a medium-depth peel be more appropriate given the established ochronosis? 2. Regarding the Q-switched ruby laser, what parameters (fluence, pulse duration, spot size) do you typically use for exogenous ochronosis? Also, how many sessions do you anticipate the patient might need, and what's the typical interval between sessions? 3.

Regarding post-peel care, are there any specific topical agents you recommend in addition to sunscreen? I was considering recommending a gentle moisturizer and a silicone-based scar gel to help with any potential post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. What are your thoughts on this? 2. You mentioned strict sun protection. Should we advise the patient to avoid sun exposure completely during the treatment period, or is limited sun exposure permissible with adequate sun protection?

My initial differential diagnosis includes: 1. **Chagas Disease (acute phase):** This is my top concern given the travel history, lymphadenopathy, fever, and eosinophilia.

I agree that cough-variant asthma is a reasonable consideration, even in the absence of classic symptoms. Before we conclude, I have a couple of further clarifying questions. Given the patient's denial of any post-nasal drip symptoms, should we also consider an inhaled nasal corticosteroid like fluticasone propionate in addition to the oral antihistamine, or would you prefer to see the response to the chlorpheniramine first? Also, regarding the chest x-ray, are there any specific findings you'd be particularly concerned about, or are we primarily looking to rule out more serious pathology in general?

Referral to gastroenterology for silent GERD evaluation is a good next step if these initial measures fail. One more question \u2013 given the patient's insistence that the cough is completely dry, how likely is UACS in your experience if there truly is no post-nasal drip component? Could the sensation of post-nasal drip be so subtle that the patient isn't aware of it? Or are there other mechanisms by which UACS can cause a dry cough?

Are there any other subtle signs or symptoms we should be looking for that might suggest pertussis, even in the absence of paroxysms? Also, given the negative response to questions about environmental exposures, should we consider performing allergy testing? While the patient denies known allergies, could an undiagnosed allergy be contributing to the UACS or even triggering the cough directly?

We have a patient presenting with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, primarily the persistent fever, evolving skin lesions, markedly elevated LDH, and the atypical lymphocytes identified in the skin biopsy. However, the normal PET/CT scan and bone marrow biopsy are throwing a wrench in that initial diagnosis. It's unusual to see such aggressive markers without evidence of widespread disease. My initial concern, given the skin involvement, was Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically Mycosis Fungoides. However, the immunohistochemistry staining positive for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1 points towards a B-cell origin, making CTCL less likely. The lack of lymphadenopathy and the normal bone marrow biopsy also argue against a systemic lymphoma. Given the negative PET/CT and bone marrow biopsy, I'm now considering alternative diagnoses.

While skin involvement can occur in mantle cell lymphoma, it's not typically a presenting feature, and the *type* of skin lesions described \u2013 evolving from flat, dark spots to raised nodules and then ulcerating sores \u2013 seems atypical. Also, the absence of lymphadenopathy is unusual, even in a leukemic phase. Before we proceed with repeat biopsies and flow cytometry, I'd like to explore a couple of points. First, the initial skin biopsy showed intravascular aggregates of atypical lymphocytes. Was there any assessment of the cellular morphology within those aggregates? Were there any comments on the size and shape of the lymphocytes, or the presence of any specific cytologic features? This might help differentiate between various lymphoma subtypes. Second,"

Adding peripheral blood flow cytometry is a good idea as well. Given the unusual presentation with prominent skin involvement and the negative systemic workup so far, I'm also wondering if we should consider some less common entities. Could this be a primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, perhaps a primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma or a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the leg type? While these are less common than mantle cell lymphoma, they often present with skin lesions. The immunohistochemistry profile isn't inconsistent with these diagnoses, though further immunophenotyping might be needed to differentiate.

A deeper skin biopsy is also essential, as it could reveal a different pattern of infiltration or identify other features not captured in the initial superficial sample. I'd like to clarify a few points regarding the repeat biopsy. Besides deeper sampling, should we also consider immunohistochemical stains for markers like BCL-2, BCL-6, and CD10? These could help further differentiate between subtypes of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, such as follicle center lymphoma versus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type.

They mentioned both flat, dark, bruise-like areas and raised nodules, some of which ulcerated. This mixed morphology raises the question of whether we might be dealing with more than one process. Could some of the lesions, particularly the flat, dark areas, represent something other than lymphoma, perhaps a vascular process or a separate dermatologic condition? It might be helpful to specifically target both types of lesions in the repeat biopsy to see if there are distinct histologic and immunophenotypic differences.

Given the chronicity of the symptoms (three years), I'm leaning slightly towards constrictive pericarditis, as mesothelioma tends to progress more rapidly. However, the asbestos exposure remains a significant red flag. Besides the pericardial biopsy, CT scan, mesothelin levels, and fluid cytology, are there any other investigations you'd recommend at this stage?

I haven't specifically asked about color changes in her fingers or toes with cold exposure, but she did report a burning sensation in her fingers, which could be a symptom. I'll add that question to the next visit. I agree that a nailfold capillaroscopy would be very helpful and will order that as well. Given the monoclonal gammopathy, I'm also considering other connective tissue diseases, although the skin findings seem most consistent with scleroderma. Could the gammopathy be related to an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder co-existing with scleroderma, or could it be a consequence of the scleroderma itself? Should we consider a bone marrow biopsy, even though the initial CBC was normal? Also, while the skin thickening and tightness are prominent features, she hasn't reported any significant gastrointestinal symptoms, pulmonary issues, or cardiac involvement.

Orthopedic surgeons specialize in the musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. The patient's description of pain, swelling, stiffness, and difficulty with activities like walking and stair climbing all point towards a problem within the knee joint itself. While the initial x-ray and physical therapy evaluation were normal, an orthopedic surgeon is best equipped to diagnose and manage more complex knee issues, potentially requiring further investigation (like MRI) or intervention (like surgery or injections) if conservative treatments fail. The doctor's suspicion of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) or early Osteoarthritis further reinforces the need for an orthopedic specialist, as these are conditions they commonly treat."

She also doesn't recall any preceding stress or illness, but that's not uncommon either. My main question for you is regarding the morphology of the lesions.

The most striking finding is the pronounced hypereosinophilia on her CBC.

Given her age and the persistent constitutional symptoms, the possibility of two concurrent processes, as you mentioned, is becoming more compelling. Even if the BAL and QuantiFERON are negative, I think it would be prudent to pursue further investigation for sarcoidosis and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Could this also be suggestive of lower eyelid retraction, perhaps due to scarring or other changes in the eyelid itself, rather than a change in globe position? 2. The patient reports the blurring is worse in dim light.

This is the most specific indicator for hematological involvement. These three findings taken together point towards a diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or another type of hemolytic anemia. Hematologists specialize in disorders of the blood, including anemias, bleeding disorders, and blood cancers.

The elevated eosinophil count, however, points us towards a different direction. He denies any known drug allergies, but the ibuprofen use is worth noting. The camping trip history, while not to an exotic location, raises the possibility of a parasitic infection, even though he doesn't recall any tick bites. My primary concern, given the combination of hematuria, eosinophilia, and the camping trip, is interstitial nephritis, possibly secondary to a drug reaction (even to over-the-counter ibuprofen) or a less common parasitic infection.

Could his lack of these symptoms argue against Schistosomiasis, or are there less symptomatic presentations we should be aware of?

Given the patient's history of long-standing COPD, treated with inhaled corticosteroids, the two-month history of hoarseness, the white patches seen on his vocal cords by ENT, and now the biopsy results showing hyperkeratosis, threadlike filaments, and positive GMS stain, I strongly suspect *Candida albicans* laryngitis. The inhaled corticosteroid use is a significant risk factor for oral and laryngeal candidiasis. While the clinical picture is highly suggestive, I'd like to confirm a few things. First, did the ENT describe the appearance of the white patches? Were they easily scraped off, or did they appear adherent? This can help differentiate candidiasis from leukoplakia or other lesions. Second, although the GMS stain is positive, it can also stain other fungi. Could we consider a fungal culture of the biopsied tissue to definitively speciate the organism?"

Beyond fungal causes, considering the patient's extensive smoking history, even though he quit 15 years ago, I'm still slightly concerned about the possibility of laryngeal leukoplakia or even early squamous cell carcinoma, despite the biopsy not showing any overtly malignant features.

Also, has he been on the same inhaled corticosteroid regimen for a long time, or has there been any recent change in dosage or medication?

I agree completely about the fresh biopsy with explicit instructions for HSV, VZV, and CMV PCR, as well as the fungal and mycobacterial stains. I've had a difficult time getting the lab to perform the requested tests on the original sample, so hopefully, a fresh biopsy with clear instructions will resolve that. I'll also push again for a detailed medication list. I've asked the patient a couple of times, but he's been hesitant to provide specifics. I'll explain the importance of having this information for a proper diagnosis. In addition to DRESS, syphilis, and other opportunistic infections, I'm also considering: * **Squamous cell carcinoma:** The pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia on the biopsy raises a slight concern, although the cyclical nature of the lesions makes this less likely."

I'll emphasize the importance of this information and try to get a more definitive answer. Given the patient's reluctance to disclose his medications, I'm wondering if we should consider other possibilities related to medication non-adherence or undisclosed drug use. Could the lesions be related to injection drug use, even if he's not disclosing it? Should we consider adding tests for other bloodborne infections like Hepatitis C?

I'm still struggling to get him to disclose the specifics of his ART regimen, which makes me wonder if there's something he's hesitant to share. Given the cyclical nature of the lesions, I'm leaning away from SCC, but the hyperplasia and now the difficulty getting a straight answer about medications makes me want to be thorough. Could the lesions be a manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), perhaps triggered by an undiagnosed opportunistic infection that's being partially suppressed by his ART? His CD4 count is within the normal range, but that doesn't entirely rule out IRIS. Should we consider broadening the infectious disease workup beyond the current list? For example, testing for less common fungal infections like"
