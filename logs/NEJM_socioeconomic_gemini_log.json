She's been using the cream daily for two years, and the symptoms have progressively worsened over the last year. My main questions for you are: 1. What other differential diagnoses should we consider, given her presentation? While the history points strongly towards exogenous ochronosis, I want to be thorough. 2.

Also, the symmetrical, mask-like distribution seems less characteristic of melasma, which often presents with more irregular patches. Could you elaborate on what aspects of her presentation might suggest these other differentials, particularly Riehl's melanosis, given its association with certain cosmetics and oils?

The PAS stain is a good idea as well, though the lack of scaling or other surface changes makes a fungal infection less likely in my mind. Given the patient's denial of new medications or cosmetics other than the lightening cream, and the fairly classic presentation for exogenous ochronosis, I'm still leaning heavily towards that diagnosis.

Second, while the patient hasn't reported any sun sensitivity or worsening of the pigmentation with sun exposure, should we still recommend strict sun protection as part of her management plan, both during and after any potential laser treatments?

I will double-check the pathology report to confirm if special stains for fungi, such as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) or Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), were performed. While the clinical picture and the non-caseating granulomas are highly suggestive of sarcoidosis, ruling out fungal infections, especially in the context of normal PFTs, is crucial. Regarding hypersensitivity pneumonitis, I agree that it should remain in the differential, especially given the crazy-paving pattern on imaging. While the normal PFTs might argue against it, they don't entirely exclude the possibility, particularly in early or milder forms. I haven't formally screened for hypersensitivity pneumonitis yet. Could you advise on the most appropriate next steps for that, considering the current findings? Should we consider a detailed occupational and environmental exposure history, specific serological tests for known antigens, or perhaps"

I'll be particularly attentive to exposures like birds, farming, moldy environments, and industrial chemicals. Regarding the LPT, if the history does point towards a specific antigen, would you recommend testing for a panel of common HP antigens, or should we focus on the suspected antigen based on the history? For example, if the patient reports bird exposure, should we just test for avian antigens, or would a broader panel be beneficial?

I'm trying to balance the potential benefits of early treatment for sarcoidosis against the risks of unnecessary steroid exposure if it turns out to be HP. 2. **Steroid tapering:** You mentioned tapering prednisone over 3-6 months. Are there specific factors that would guide us towards a shorter versus longer tapering schedule?

I understand it's unlikely, but given the granulomas, I want to be absolutely certain before starting steroids. 2. **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) follow-up:** If the patient responds well to steroids, and we presume it's sarcoidosis, should we still consider follow-up HP testing down the line if the cough recurs or if there are any future respiratory issues?

These findings, combined with the persistent cough, strongly suggest a pulmonary issue beyond the initial considerations. The subsequent high-resolution CT scan confirmed these findings, further pointing towards a pulmonary cause. Even though pulmonary function tests were normal and serum ACE levels were not elevated, the imaging findings and persistent cough warranted further investigation by a lung specialist. The final bronchoscopy with biopsy, ordered by the doctor and performed presumably by a pulmonologist, confirmed a diagnosis (likely sarcoidosis given the granulomas).

Also, while the catheterization data is highly suggestive, the patient's relatively normal echocardiogram is somewhat puzzling. Is it common to see a normal echo in the presence of constrictive pericarditis, especially in the early stages? Could the pericardial thickening be subtle and missed on the initial echo, or are there other echocardiographic findings we should look for retrospectively that might have been overlooked?

Regarding medical management, what specific medications would you consider in this case prior to surgery? Would anti-inflammatory drugs be appropriate, or are diuretics and other heart failure medications more beneficial in managing the symptoms of constrictive pericarditis? 2. The patient's weight gain is predominantly abdominal. While this could be a consequence of the constrictive pericarditis and resulting fluid shifts, could there be other contributing factors we should consider, such as liver involvement or even malignancy, especially given the insidious onset and chronic nature of the symptoms?

Before proceeding with the MRI and other tests, I want to revisit the patient's history one last time. While the patient denies any specific chest trauma, they did mention experiencing tightness, albeit not sharp pain, which is somewhat relieved by leaning forward. This leans towards pericarditis, but I'm wondering if we should consider a very remote possibility of a slow-growing, atypical cardiac mass causing external compression, mimicking some of the features of constrictive pericarditis.

We have a patient with a persistent IgG monoclonal gammopathy, coupled with a constellation of symptoms that don't neatly fit into a typical multiple myeloma picture. The rash, described as greasy, skin-colored to reddish bumps causing deep wrinkles, particularly between the eyebrows, is unusual. The burning, numbness, and tingling in the hands, spreading to the arms and face, worse at night, along with thickened nails and morning blurry vision, points towards a possible peripheral neuropathy. The fact that the free light chain assay, skeletal survey, and UPEP are normal argues against significant multiple myeloma progression at this point. My primary concern is the combination of the MGUS and the evolving neuropathy. While the MGUS could be incidental, the progression of the neuropathy warrants a closer look at potential underlying causes.

I agree that we shouldn't rule out POEMS solely based on the IgG type. Given the combination of neuropathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and now the possibility of xanthomas, I'm wondering if we should consider a rarer entity like Schnitzler syndrome.

Before we finalize the MRI request, I have a couple of final thoughts: 1. **Regarding the mechanism of injury:** The patient described simply stepping off an auto-rickshaw when the pain and buckling occurred. While this seems like a low-energy mechanism for such a significant and bilateral injury, it's possible that a pre-existing condition predisposed them to this event. I'm wondering if underlying patellar tendinopathy, perhaps asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic until the rickshaw incident, could have weakened the tendons, making them susceptible to injury with minimal force. The subsequent four years of progressively worsening symptoms could represent chronic tendinopathy exacerbated by the initial event. 2. **Metabolic factors:** Given the bilateral presentation and the seemingly spontaneous nature"

Before we wrap up, I have a few remaining considerations: 1. **Patellar tracking:** While we're focusing on the patellar tendon, I'd like to ensure the physical exam also includes a careful assessment of patellar tracking. Given the anterior knee pain and difficulty with extension, patellar maltracking, potentially exacerbated by the rickshaw incident, could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This could also explain the \"dip\" above the kneecaps if it's related to altered patellar position rather than tendon thickening. 2. **Pre-existing conditions:** While we haven't uncovered any family history of joint problems, I'd like to delve a little deeper into"

Should we perhaps broaden the scope of our investigation for parasites or consider a specific test for hypersensitivity pneumonitis before the more invasive bronchoscopy?

Regarding the OCT and HVF, I agree they would be valuable. The OCT will help us visualize the retinal layers and optic nerve, looking for any signs of atrophy, edema, or other abnormalities. The HVF will provide a detailed map of the patient's visual field, which can help pinpoint the location of the vision loss and differentiate between corneal, retinal, and neurological causes.

Given the two-month history of hoarseness preceding the discovery of the candidiasis, I'm wondering if the fungal infection was secondary to something else. Could the chronic irritation from smoking and COPD have created a favorable environment for the candida to flourish? Or could there be another underlying laryngeal pathology that we're missing?

While the negative STI tests might seem to point away from this specialty, the patient presents with recurring sores with a cyclical nature, suggestive of a potential infectious process. The fact that common STIs have been ruled out doesn't eliminate the possibility of a less common or atypical infection. The doctor is also considering Beh\u00e7et's disease, which, while having an unclear etiology, often involves symptoms that mimic infections and is sometimes managed by infectious disease specialists due to its similarities to infectious processes. Furthermore, the patient is HIV positive, which further strengthens the rationale for an infectious disease consultation as it can impact the presentation and management of other infections."

This patient presents with recurring, painful genital ulcers that have been ongoing for a year, with a cyclical pattern of appearance and resolution. All standard STI testing, including HSV PCR, syphilis serologies, and HIV viral load (though positive, at a low level and with a normal CD4 count) have not provided a clear etiology. Biopsy showed nonspecific findings of inflammation and epidermal changes. Importantly, the patient denies any systemic symptoms. My primary concern, given the chronicity and the negative infectious workup, is something along the lines of Beh\u00e7et's disease, as the physician mentioned. The genital ulcers are a hallmark of Beh\u00e7et's, and while we haven't seen any other manifestations like oral or ocular lesions, they can be intermittent. I'd like to explore that avenue further. My questions are: 1. **Regarding the genital ulcers:**"

Beyond Beh\u00e7et's, are there any other conditions we should consider in the differential at this point, given the negative infectious workup and the chronicity of the ulcers? Could this be a form of recurrent fixed drug eruption, even though the patient denies using any new medications? Are there any other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions that might manifest primarily with genital ulceration? Finally, should we consider a referral to dermatology for a second opinion and potentially further biopsies for more specialized histopathological analysis?"

While LGV and granuloma inguinale are less common, they are important to rule out. Could you advise on the best testing strategy for these? Would serology be sufficient, or should we consider specific lesion swabs for PCR or other diagnostic modalities? Given his HIV-positive status, even with a well-controlled viral load, could these infections present atypically? Regarding the dermatology referral, I'll arrange that promptly.

Regarding the dermatology referral, I will request DIF and special stains for fungal and mycobacterial infections as you suggested. I'll also specifically ask them to consider cutaneous manifestations of systemic diseases. To help guide both my questioning and the dermatologist's assessment, could you provide a few examples of systemic diseases that might manifest with recurrent genital ulcerations, besides Beh\u00e7et's? I'm thinking broadly here, including vasculitides, connective tissue disorders, and other inflammatory conditions.

Regarding Crohn's disease, while genital ulcers can occur, they are typically associated with perianal disease. Did you have a specific reason for suggesting Crohn's in this case, given the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms or perianal involvement? Should we consider fecal calprotectin or other inflammatory bowel markers, even in the absence of GI symptoms? 2. Reactive arthritis often follows an infection. While we've ruled out common STIs, could the initial HIV infection, even if it occurred some time ago, be the triggering event? Should we explore HLA-B2"
