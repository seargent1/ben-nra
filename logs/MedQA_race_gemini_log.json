The patient presents with a one-month history of binocular diplopia, proximal muscle weakness affecting both upper and lower limbs, and difficulty climbing stairs. The symptoms worsen with exertion and improve with rest, a classic finding for neuromuscular junction disorders. She also reports eyelid heaviness, particularly in the evenings. The acetylcholine receptor antibody test came back positive, strongly suggesting myasthenia gravis (MG). Other lab work, including CBC, CMP, TSH, and CK, were all within normal limits. I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of MG, but I'd like your opinion on a few things. First, while the symptoms are suggestive of ocular and generalized MG, are there any other neuromuscular conditions we should consider in the differential diagnosis given her presentation? I'm thinking specifically about Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), although the lack of autonomic symptoms makes it less likely. Second, the"

While it can be helpful, I'm hesitant given its declining use due to the availability and sensitivity of the AChR antibody test, which is positive in this case. Furthermore, the Tensilon test can have false positives and carries some risks. I'm more inclined to proceed with electromyography (EMG) with repetitive nerve stimulation to assess for a decremental response, which would further support the MG diagnosis. What are your thoughts on that approach? Also, given the patient's description of worsening symptoms in the evenings and upon waking, I'm wondering about the potential impact of sleep quality and diurnal variation of AChR antibody levels. Could this be influencing the symptom fluctuation, or should we consider other"

I hadn't considered sleep apnea as a contributing factor to the symptom fluctuation, particularly the worsening upon waking. While she hasn't reported any specific breathing difficulties, I will ask her specifically about symptoms suggestive of sleep apnea, such as snoring, witnessed apneas, or daytime sleepiness. If those are present, a sleep study would be warranted. Given the positive AChR antibodies and the clinical picture, I'm fairly confident in the MG diagnosis. However, before initiating treatment, are there any other specific investigations you would recommend to assess the extent of the disease and rule out any other potential contributing factors, such as a thymoma? Would a chest CT or MRI be indicated at this stage? Also, considering the potential for other autoimmune conditions to co-exist with MG, would you recommend"

A baseline PFT is a good idea as well, to assess respiratory muscle function and establish a baseline for future monitoring, especially given the potential for myasthenic crisis. Given the patient's age, and assuming the chest CT and further autoimmune screening are unremarkable, would you recommend proceeding directly with standard first-line treatment for MG, such as pyridostigmine, or are there any other factors we should consider before initiating treatment?

The MRI results have returned, and unfortunately, they show lesions in your brain consistent with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a serious brain infection caused by the JC virus. While it's rare, it can occur in patients taking natalizumab, the medication you're on for Crohn's disease. Do you recall ever being tested for the JC virus antibody? Doctor: I know this is a lot to take in. Have you been experiencing any cognitive changes recently, such as difficulty with memory, thinking, or concentration, even subtle ones? Doctor: We need to discuss your treatment options immediately. This will involve stopping the natalizumab and consulting with a neurologist specializing in PML. Are you able to come in tomorrow morning to discuss this further and make a plan?"

Initial blood work (CBC, CMP) and urinalysis were unremarkable. The abdominal x-ray revealed dilated bowel loops and an absence of rectal gas, raising suspicion for a bowel obstruction. However, the subsequent abdominal ultrasound was normal. A contrast enema then demonstrated a transition zone in the distal colon, suggestive of Hirschsprung's disease. The mother reports infrequent, pellet-like stools, further supporting this possibility. My primary concern is Hirschsprung's disease, given the contrast enema findings and the clinical picture. However, I'"

To answer your question about meconium passage, I haven't specifically asked the mother about that yet, but I will inquire about the timing and nature of his first stool after birth. It's a crucial piece of information. While Hirschsprung's seems the most likely diagnosis at this point, I'd like to explore a couple of other points. First, given the acute onset of symptoms, could there be a contributing factor like enterocolitis superimposed on a previously undiagnosed Hirschsprung's? His lack of fever is somewhat reassuring, but the abdominal tenderness and distension still warrant consideration. Second, although the ultrasound was normal, could we consider other rarer causes of distal bowel obstruction, such as a small left colon syndrome, particularly if the biopsy comes back inconclusive for Hirschsprung's? I understand it often resolves spontaneously, but it could explain the acute presentation. Finally, regarding the rectal biopsy,"

I'll be particularly vigilant for any changes in his condition, such as increased abdominal distension, worsening tenderness, or any signs of lethargy or sepsis. Given the potential severity of enterocolitis in this context, would you recommend prophylactic antibiotics at this stage, or should we hold off until there's stronger evidence of infection? Also, while we await the biopsy results, should we consider any specific bowel preparation regimen, or is that best deferred until after the diagnosis is confirmed?

Regarding the single-stage pull-through, do you typically prefer a transanal approach (like the Soave or Swenson procedures) or a laparoscopic-assisted approach in this age group? Are there any specific factors in this patient's presentation that might influence your decision one way or the other? 2.

While the absence of gas in the rectum on the initial x-ray is consistent with Hirschsprung's, could you comment on the presence of dilated bowel loops *above* the transition zone?

My primary differential at this point is Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). It often presents with rapidly enlarging nodes, B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), and can be associated with itching. The elevated WBC count and slightly low hemoglobin also fit this picture.

Sometimes localized itching can point towards an underlying nodal mass. Also, have we considered performing immunohistochemistry stains on the biopsy for MYC and BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements?

While the initial biopsy pointed towards a high proliferative index, could we be dealing with a Richter's transformation, even if it's less common without prior history of a low-grade lymphoma? Should we consider adding flow cytometry to the biopsy analysis to look for any atypical cell populations that might suggest this?

While the CT scan showed widespread lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly could be subtle and easily missed, particularly if the focus was primarily on the lymph nodes. Splenic involvement could further support a diagnosis of DLBCL or other aggressive lymphomas. Secondly, given the patient's itching, although generalized, I'm wondering if we should consider paraneoplastic processes. While less common in DLBCL, could we be missing a concomitant process? Perhaps checking for elevated serum tryptase or other markers of mast cell activation might be worthwhile, even if a long shot. Finally, while we're considering"

She denies any popping or giving way. There's no reported swelling or warmth, and rest and ice provide minimal relief. Ibuprofen hasn't been effective. She denies prior knee injuries. My primary concern is a meniscus tear, possibly of the medial meniscus given the location of the pain. However, the lack of significant effusion and the intermittent nature of the catching are somewhat atypical. What are your initial thoughts? Do you think the mechanism of injury (repetitive pivoting during volleyball) supports a meniscus tear diagnosis? Should we consider other diagnoses like patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), medial plica syndrome, or even a ligamentous injury at this stage? I've already ordered"

I did order an MRI, primarily to rule out a meniscus or ligamentous injury, as you suggested. It will also be helpful in assessing the plica. Regarding PFPS, her pain is quite localized to the medial aspect, which is less typical for PFPS, isn't it? I was leaning towards medial plica syndrome as a stronger possibility given the intermittent catching and medial pain. Could the pivoting motion in volleyball irritate the plica and cause this type of presentation? Also, she mentioned she's been trying to lose weight recently and has PCOS. Could hormonal factors or rapid weight loss contribute to her symptoms, perhaps by affecting joint lubrication or cartilage health?"

Would you agree that an MRI is the best next step to definitively differentiate between these possibilities and rule out other less likely diagnoses like a ligamentous injury? If the MRI comes back negative for a meniscus tear, would you recommend a diagnostic injection into the plica to see if that provides relief and confirms the diagnosis? Also, what are your thoughts on conservative management strategies in the meantime?

I'll also put in the referral for physical therapy. A couple of follow-up questions: 1. Given her description of the catching sensation as \"something getting stuck,\" and the intermittent nature of it, should we be considering any loose bodies within the joint? While a meniscus tear is less likely given the lack of effusion and locking, could a small flap tear or a piece of cartilage be causing this intermittent catching? Would the MRI be sensitive enough to pick that up? 2. If the MRI is negative for both a meniscus tear and a prominent plica, what would be our next steps? Should we consider"

If the MRI is negative for a tear, significant plica, and loose bodies, could we consider a course of physical therapy focused on strengthening the muscles around the knee, particularly the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), and improving patellar tracking?

Just to confirm my understanding regarding the carotid sinus massage: we're holding off unless the syncope recurs or the ambulatory ECG is unrevealing. This makes sense given the potential risks associated with the procedure and the currently strong suspicion of a benign cause. One final question: while the patient denies orthostatic symptoms in general, the timing of the event immediately post-micturition raises a slight flag. Even though a tilt-table test is likely low-yield, would you consider checking orthostatic vital signs in the office just to document a baseline? It might help further solidify the vasovagal diagnosis if they are normal, and could potentially uncover subtle orthostatic hypotension that wasn't apparent to the patient."

Similarly, a neurological event like a seizure seems unlikely given the lack of any post-ictal confusion or other neurological findings.

Stools are runny and green, and the mother reports no tears during crying. While the CBC was normal, the combination of these symptoms is worrying. My primary differential diagnoses include a cardiac issue, respiratory distress, and potentially a metabolic or digestive problem. The cyanosis during feeding makes me suspicious of a cardiac shunt or other congenital heart defect that is exacerbated by the exertion of feeding. Respiratory distress, perhaps due to a congenital diaphragmatic hernia or other pulmonary abnormality, could also explain the feeding difficulties and cyanosis.

Given the possibility of a cardiac issue, and considering that the cyanosis is exacerbated during feeding, I'm wondering if there could be a vascular ring or other vascular anomaly compressing the trachea or esophagus. Could this explain both the respiratory distress during feeding and the potential for GI symptoms? Should we consider a barium swallow study or other imaging to evaluate the esophagus and surrounding structures?

Appendicitis is less likely given the localization of pain, but we should keep it in mind.

Clindamycin does have anaerobic activity, but metronidazole offers broader coverage, especially against *Bacteroides fragilis*, which can be implicated in postpartum infections.

Given the patient's age (I should have mentioned that earlier - he's 48), and the fact that the bleeding is bright red and painless, I'm still leaning towards hemorrhoids as the most likely culprit. However, with the family history, we can't be too careful. Do you think a flexible sigmoidoscopy would be a reasonable alternative to a full colonoscopy in this case, or given the family history, should we stick with the full colonoscopy to ensure complete visualization?

Or perhaps something else entirely, like a polyp that intermittently prolapses? Also, while the CBC was normal, I'm curious about the patient's iron levels. Even with bright red blood, chronic low-grade bleeding could potentially lead to iron deficiency anemia over time. Would you recommend checking ferritin levels as well, just to be comprehensive?

She required assistance exiting the vehicle due to pain and immobility. She denies loss of consciousness, head injury, or other associated injuries.

While rare in this type of dislocation, could a subtle fracture be missed on plain film?

Would you typically recommend a period of conservative management with observation and physical therapy, or would you consider earlier surgical intervention for certain types of sciatic nerve injuries associated with posterior hip dislocation? Also, while the pre-reduction CT will help rule out any subtle acetabular fractures, I'm still mindful of the possibility of associated injuries within the hip joint itself.

While the contrast enema doesn't definitively rule out atresia or stenosis, the transition zone is a hallmark of Hirschsprung's.

For example, are there specific abnormalities in nerve fiber hypertrophy or acetylcholinesterase staining patterns that might suggest NID? 2.

While a mallet finger is the most likely diagnosis, could the absence of avulsion fracture on the x-ray, coupled with the mechanism of injury, suggest a possible tendon subluxation instead? Although less common, I want to ensure we haven't overlooked this possibility. Should we consider a dynamic ultrasound to definitively rule out a tendon subluxation, or is it reasonable to proceed with splinting and re-evaluate if the DIP joint doesn't respond as expected? Also, regarding the Stack splint, are there any specific recommendations for the type or material? Should it be pre-fabricated or custom-made? And finally, while splinting for 6-8 weeks is the standard, should we schedule a follow-up X-ray after a few weeks to confirm there's no delayed bony avulsion that wasn't initially visible"

We'll initiate treatment with a pre-fabricated Stack splint for 6-8 weeks, followed by a hand therapy referral. We'll forgo the dynamic ultrasound and follow-up X-ray for now, reserving those for potential complications or lack of progress.

While the ultrasound describes the lesion as cystic, lipomas can sometimes have a similar appearance on ultrasound, especially if they have undergone some degree of necrosis or cystic degeneration. Is there anything specific about the ultrasound description (aside from the cystic appearance) that would help differentiate between a lipoma and a true cyst?

Are there any other less common hospital-acquired infections we should be thinking about, particularly given the patient's recent antibiotic exposure?

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, recent leg swelling, and enlarged veins further complicates the picture. My initial differential includes: * **Infected diabetic ulcer:** Given the patient's diabetes and the ulcer's characteristics, this is high on my list. The impaired circulation and neuropathy associated with diabetes increase the risk of developing ulcers, which can easily become infected. The ankle swelling and venous changes suggest possible venous insufficiency, further contributing to the problem. * **Pyoderma gangrenosum:** This inflammatory skin condition can present with painful ulcers that rapidly expand. While less common than an infected diabetic ulcer, it should be considered, especially given the purplish border and the patient's inflammatory response to insect bites. * **Cellulitis:** The expanding redness, pain, and pus"

Given the patient's report of increased inflammation to insect bites, should we also consider other less common infections like ecthyma gangrenosum or even a cutaneous anthrax, though Wisconsin isn't a typical endemic area? I'm also wondering if the mesalamine, prescribed presumably for inflammatory bowel disease, could be contributing to an unusual skin manifestation or increased susceptibility to infection. Finally, while pyoderma gangrenosum is a possibility, it typically presents with more undermined borders, and I'm not seeing that here. What are your thoughts on these additional considerations?"

I'll order the Doppler ultrasound and wound culture immediately. I'll also add a CBC with differential to assess for systemic signs of infection and evaluate the white cell count. Given the patient's travel history, even though Wisconsin isn't typically associated with unusual infections, could we consider adding some additional tests to the wound culture, perhaps for atypical mycobacteria or fungal infections, just to be thorough? While unlikely, it could be helpful to have that information if the initial cultures don't yield anything definitive. Regarding the mesalamine, should we consider a temporary discontinuation to see if the lesion improves, or is it best to wait for the culture results first?

Just to clarify a few points and ensure we're covering all bases: 1. **Regarding the Doppler:** Should we also consider a venous duplex ultrasound to assess for venous insufficiency, given the patient's ankle swelling and visible enlarged veins? This could help determine if venous stasis is contributing to the ulcer and guide treatment if compression therapy is warranted. 2. **Wound Culture Specificity:** For the standard wound culture, should we specifically request testing for any particular bacteria beyond the usual aerobic and anaerobic panels, given the unusual presentation and chronicity? For example, should we consider adding coverage for organisms like *Pseudomonas* or MRSA, which can be more aggressive in diabetic ulcers? 3. **"

The ultrasound strongly suggests a uterine rupture at the site of her previous C-section scar, with hemoperitoneum confirmed. Her hemoglobin is slightly low, but platelets and coagulation studies are within normal limits. The sudden cessation of contractions after the onset of bleeding and pain is also highly suspicious for a rupture. My primary concern, given the clinical picture and ultrasound findings, is a complete uterine rupture. While the bleeding isn't *profuse* yet, the combination of pain, cessation of fetal movement, and ultrasound findings makes this the most likely diagnosis. Differential diagnoses to consider, although less likely given the ultrasound, would include placental abruption. However, the localized pain and ultrasound findings point more towards a rupture."

This patient presents with acute onset lower back pain radiating down the lateral aspect of the leg to the foot, described as sharp, stabbing, and electric shock-like.

He also reports tingling and weakness in the affected leg. No bowel or bladder incontinence is noted, and this is his first episode of such pain. Coughing and sneezing do not exacerbate the pain. My primary differential diagnosis is a lumbar disc herniation, likely at L4-L5 or L5-S1, affecting the L5 or S1 nerve root respectively, given the lateral leg pain and associated tingling and weakness. The sudden onset during exercise further supports this. Other possibilities to consider, though less likely given the presentation, include lumbar muscle strain, spinal stenosis"

Given the patient's significant pain level (8/10) and reported weakness, should we consider any additional diagnostic tests alongside the MRI, such as an EMG/NCV study, to further assess the degree of nerve involvement and rule out other less likely diagnoses like radiculopathy from other causes? Also, while oral steroids can be helpful for inflammation, what are your thoughts on starting with a short course of NSAIDs first, considering the potential side effects of steroids? Finally, regarding physical therapy, would you recommend starting with a more conservative approach initially, focusing on pain management and gentle mobilization, before progressing to more active exercises once the acute phase subsides?

While we're fairly confident in the disc herniation diagnosis, the patient mentioned the pain started during exercise. Do you think it's worthwhile to explore the *type* of exercise he was performing when the pain began? Could certain movements, like a heavy deadlift or squat, suggest a greater likelihood of a specific type of herniation (e.g., extrusion vs. protrusion)? While this might not significantly alter our immediate management, it could be useful information for the PT and for patient education regarding future exercise modifications. 2. Regarding the advice against prolonged static postures, should we provide specific timeframes? For example, should we advise against sitting or standing for longer than, say"

Regarding the doxycycline, if this *were* Lyme disease, wouldn't a longer course be necessary? The typical course for NGU is much shorter than what would be required for Lyme. Should we consider a longer course of doxycycline from the outset, covering both potential diagnoses, or would you prefer to wait for the Lyme serology results before extending the duration?

I didn't observe any obvious ulceration clinically, but the biopsy will provide a definitive answer. The varying shades of brown described by the patient corresponded to areas of different pigmentation on dermoscopy, ranging from light brown to almost black in some areas.

Before we schedule the colonoscopy, I have a couple of clarifying questions. First, regarding the patient's description of \"incomplete evacuation,\" did they elaborate on what that feels like?

Given that microscopic colitis is high on our differential, should we proceed directly to colonoscopy after the stool studies and fecal calprotectin, or would you prefer to wait for those results first? I'm leaning towards proceeding with the colonoscopy regardless, as it allows for direct visualization and biopsies, which would provide a definitive diagnosis.

I understand microscopic colitis can sometimes be patchy, and we want to ensure we don't miss it. Also, while we suspect microscopic colitis, are there any other less common conditions we should consider in the differential, given the mucus and chronicity? For example, could this be a presentation of collagenous sprue, or perhaps even a low-grade carcinoid tumor, although I acknowledge that's less likely given the absence of other concerning symptoms?

While ovarian cancer seems most likely, given the ascites and known ovarian mass, I'd like to explore a few other less probable, but important differentials. Could the patient's symptoms be related to heart failure? The shortness of breath worsened by exertion and lying down, along with abdominal distension, could suggest that. Has she had any history of cardiac issues? An echocardiogram might be helpful to assess cardiac function. Also, while the patient denies weight loss, the early satiety makes me wonder about potential nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption issues. Could we consider checking a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess her overall health and nutritional status? Finally, though less likely given the known ovarian mass, could other benign gynecological conditions be contributing, such as a large benign ovarian cyst or pelvic inflammatory disease? The CT scan should help clarify"

I'll also schedule the patient for a paracentesis, given her significant discomfort from the ascites. Analyzing the ascitic fluid for cytology is crucial for confirming malignancy and potentially identifying the specific cancer type. Regarding the paracentesis, should we consider sending the fluid for additional tests beyond cytology, such as protein levels, glucose, LDH, and amylase? This could help differentiate between malignant ascites and other causes of fluid buildup, like those related to liver disease or infection. While I understand ovarian cancer is the most likely diagnosis, I want to be thorough in ruling out other possibilities. Given the patient's age (implied to be young due to mentioning \"school\"), I'm wondering about rarer conditions. Could we consider Meigs' syndrome, although it'"

Given her age and the possibility, however remote, of a germ cell tumor, should we also consider adding alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-hCG to the tumor marker panel? While the lack of nausea and vomiting makes a rapidly growing germ cell tumor less likely, I think it's worth checking to be comprehensive. Also, regarding the CT scan, should we order it with and without contrast, or just with contrast? I'm leaning towards with contrast to better visualize the mass and any potential spread, but I wanted to get your input. Finally, in anticipation of a potential malignancy, and considering the patient's young age, should we discuss a referral to a gynecologic oncologist sooner rather than later? While"

I appreciate your guidance on this. Just a couple more points for clarification: While we suspect ovarian cancer, the lack of some typical symptoms like significant weight loss and pain makes me want to be absolutely thorough. Given the patient's relatively young age and the mention of \"school,\" could we consider adding lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to the blood work? Elevated LDH, while non-specific, can sometimes be associated with certain malignancies, including lymphoma, which, while less likely, could present with ascites. Also, while the CT with contrast will be helpful, would there be any benefit in adding a chest CT, perhaps without contrast, to rule out pleural effusions and assess for any potential spread to the lungs or mediastinal"

The patient presents with shortness of breath, increased abdominal girth (ascites), and a known ovarian mass. These symptoms, particularly in combination, are highly suspicious for **ovarian cancer**. Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen) is a common complication of ovarian cancer. The progressive nature of the shortness of breath, coupled with the abdominal pressure, further suggests malignancy. While other specialists might be involved in the patient's care at some point, the initial referral and primary management of a suspected ovarian malignancy falls under the purview of a Gynecologic Oncologist. They are the specialists trained to diagnose and treat cancers of the female reproductive system."
