The patient describes the affected areas as bluish-brown with underlying redness, visible telangiectasias, and a sandpaper-like texture. She also reports mild itching, particularly when hot or flushed, and the presence of small, dark freckle-like spots within the larger patches.

To answer your question, I specifically asked the patient about other medications, and she denied using any other topical or systemic medications besides the hydroquinone cream and a regular moisturizer. She did not mention amiodarone, and given her age and lack of other reported health issues, it seems less likely, but I will confirm this with her before the biopsy.

I'll also specifically ask the patient about the cough during sleep. That's a very helpful point about psychogenic cough. Given the chronicity and the persistent throat clearing, I'm leaning towards a localized laryngeal issue or perhaps an atypical infectious process, though the lack of systemic symptoms makes the latter less likely. I'm particularly interested in the laryngoscopy findings. Should we consider a trial of inhaled corticosteroids, even with the negative asthma workup so far, just in case there's some subtle airway inflammation contributing to the cough? Or would you prefer to wait for the laryngoscopy and chest x-ray results before considering that? Also, while we're considering less common causes, are there any other conditions we should be thinking about? For example, could this be related to a"

A pulmonologist can perform more specialized tests like pulmonary function tests, bronchoscopy, or imaging studies to determine the underlying cause of the cough, which could range from relatively benign conditions like asthma or post-nasal drip to more serious conditions."

However, given the insidious nature of CNS involvement in IVLBCL, I think a brain MRI is warranted to definitively exclude this. My primary concern, even with the highly suggestive biopsy, is the lack of bone marrow involvement. While bone marrow involvement isn't always present in IVLBCL, it's reported in a significant percentage of cases. Would you recommend a bone marrow biopsy at this stage? Also, while the patient denies any specific risk factors like recent travel or immunosuppression, I'm wondering if we should consider infectious etiologies, even though"

I'm leaning towards both to maximize sensitivity. 2. **Regarding other infectious differentials:** Given the patient's persistent fever and lack of other clear infectious symptoms, should we also consider less common infections like Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or even fungal infections in the differential?

However, I still have a few lingering questions regarding diagnostics and the unusual presentation: 1. **Regarding the absence of B symptoms:** While not unheard of, the lack of night sweats is somewhat atypical in IVLBCL, especially with such a high LDH. Could this suggest a less aggressive variant or perhaps a different subtype of lymphoma altogether, even with the characteristic intravascular pattern on biopsy? Should we consider performing a PET/CT scan to better assess disease burden and look for any occult sites of involvement that might explain the unusual presentation? 2. **Regarding the bone marrow biopsy:** While we agreed on its importance, I'm curious about your thoughts on the"

However, given the unusual presentation and the potential for diagnostic surprises, I'd like to propose a few additional considerations: 1. **Regarding the PET/CT:** While helpful for staging, could we also use the PET/CT scan to guide the repeat skin biopsy? Targeting a highly metabolically active lesion might increase the yield of atypical lymphocytes and improve the accuracy of flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining. 2. **Regarding the differential diagnosis:** While IVLBCL is the leading contender, the unusual presentation still prompts me to consider other, albeit less likely,"

Now, while I agree that restrictive cardiomyopathy needs to be thoroughly investigated, I'm still somewhat anchored on the pericardial calcification. Even if it's not the primary driver of the patient's symptoms, it's a significant finding that warrants further exploration.

Have you seen cases where quadriceps weakness, potentially exacerbated by dialysis, plays a significant role in chronic knee pain and instability, even without overt patellar pathology? Also, while the patient denies any popping or tearing sensation, the sudden buckling and subsequent chronic symptoms make me wonder about potential ligamentous injury, perhaps a subtle sprain or tear that wasn't apparent on the initial imaging.

Could the linear pattern be suggestive of a dermatomal distribution, even without the classic pain of shingles? Should we consider a less common variant of herpes zoster, zoster sine herpete, which presents without rash? Also, given the \"crater-like\" description of the lesions, could we be looking at a deeper inflammatory process, perhaps even a form of folliculitis that happens to have a linear presentation?

Four months of intense itching without any reported pain seems quite unusual, even for zoster sine herpete. Is there a particular serotype of VZV that tends to present with more pruritus than pain? While I'll perform the skin scraping for scabies and send off the PCR for VZV, I'm still slightly uneasy about dismissing scabies entirely, even with the negative burrow report and lack of household transmission. Could the patient be particularly resistant to the mites, leading to a prolonged, localized infestation without the typical spread? Or could there be a scenario where the mites are present but the burrows are atypical or difficult to visualize?"

First, if it were crusted scabies, wouldn't we expect a more widespread distribution, even if localized to the back? The description of \"crater-like\" lesions also doesn't quite fit the typical picture of crusted scabies, does it? Second, regarding the possibility of atypical zoster, are there any other accompanying symptoms, besides pain, that might be absent in a prolonged case like this?

I'm thinking along the lines of linear lichen planus, linear psoriasis, or even a peculiar presentation of granuloma annulare. While these are less common, they might be worth considering if the initial tests are negative.

The subtle lower lid retraction you mentioned, combined with the progressive vision changes, makes me lean towards a process affecting the orbit, even if subtly. While thyroid eye disease is still on the differential, the normal thyroid panel and lack of other typical symptoms make it less likely. I'm particularly intrigued by the possibility of orbital pseudotumor, especially given the negative workup so far. Could we consider an orbital MRI with contrast to evaluate for any inflammation or masses within the orbit? This would help us visualize the extraocular muscles and assess for any signs of restrictive myopathy as well. Regarding paraneoplastic syndrome, are there any specific tumor markers you'd recommend checking based on the patient's presentation? While it's a less common possibility, the unexplained progressive vision loss warrants considering it.

Regarding the Schirmer's test, alongside tear osmolarity and lipid interferometry if it comes back low, should we also consider evaluating for corneal staining with fluorescein or lissamine green?

I'll also ask about any recent strep infections, though he denies any fever or other symptoms suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The repeat urinalysis with microscopy for dysmorphic RBCs and casts is a good idea. That will help differentiate between glomerular and non-glomerular sources of bleeding.

I agree that cystoscopy could be considered if the hematuria persists after these additional investigations. However, given his age and the absence of any lower urinary tract symptoms, I'm hesitant to jump to cystoscopy too quickly.

Regarding the renal biopsy, I agree that it should be considered if the less invasive tests don't yield a diagnosis.

He's a former smoker with a history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, now with some dyspnea at rest, wheezing (especially at night), and a chronic cough productive of clear/white sputum. This presentation initially suggested COPD, but the pulmonary function tests don't support that. The new onset of hoarseness, lasting for two months, adds another layer of complexity. While COPD can sometimes cause hoarseness due to chronic coughing and throat irritation, the normal PFTs make that less likely. I've questioned him about thyroid issues, neck injuries, and environmental exposures, all of which he denies. He also denies any other neurological symptoms like difficulty swallowing or limb weakness, although he admits his voice has changed significantly. Given the hoarseness"

However, given the normal PFTs, it's worth exploring. I'm also wondering about less common causes. Could his hoarseness and dyspnea be related? Perhaps a neurological process affecting both the recurrent laryngeal nerve and respiratory function? While he denies other neurological symptoms, some subtle neuromuscular disorders could present this way. Have you encountered similar cases?

Given the potential for a neurological component, I'm wondering if we should also consider a neurological consultation. While he denies other neurological symptoms, the combination of hoarseness and progressive dyspnea, even with normal PFTs, is unusual. Are there specific neuromuscular disorders you'd recommend screening for, given this presentation? Also, regarding the methacholine challenge test, would you recommend doing that before or after the chest CT?

I agree that PCR for HSV and other less common pathogens on the biopsy is a good next step if the initial serology and RPR are negative. To clarify the timeline, the patient has been experiencing these ulcers for about a year, with monthly recurrences. Is there a particular timeframe within which a fixed drug eruption would typically manifest after starting a new medication? Also, would we expect to see complete resolution of the ulcers between outbreaks in a fixed drug eruption, as this patient describes? Regarding Beh\u00e7et's, while the genital ulcers are a key feature, the absence of other symptoms like oral ulcers, uveitis, or skin lesions makes it less probable. However, I'll still inquire about any history of these symptoms, as well as any family history of Beh\u00e7et's. Given the patient"

The patient presents with recurring genital sores that ulcerate, a symptom highly suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The patient's existing HIV diagnosis further underscores the need for an ID specialist, as they are best equipped to manage the complexities of STIs in immunocompromised individuals. While a dermatologist *could* diagnose and treat *some* STIs, an ID specialist has a broader understanding of the interplay between various infections, especially in the context of HIV. They can also provide comprehensive sexual health counseling and management."
