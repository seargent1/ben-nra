The distribution around the cheeks, nose, and mouth is characteristic of melasma, but the bluish-brown hue and leathery texture are atypical. The negative homogentisic acid result rules out endogenous ochronosis. However, the patient's admission of using a skin-lightening cream, particularly one purchased online without clear ingredient labeling (\"MelanoFade\"), strongly suggests exogenous ochronosis. My primary concern is exogenous ochronosis induced by hydroquinone or a similar ingredient in the \"MelanoFade\" cream. The dermoscopy and skin biopsy findings, though not explicitly described, seem consistent with this diagnosis. The lack of darkening of gums, lips, or other mucosal surfaces further supports exogenous rather than endogenous ochronosis. I have a few questions for"

The patient explicitly denied taking any medications, including ACE-inhibitors, so that seems unlikely. Pertussis is a possibility given the duration, although the lack of paroxysms or whooping is atypical. I agree that cough-variant asthma and a subtle allergic reaction are still on the table despite the lack of classic symptoms. A trial of antihistamines or a short course of steroids is a reasonable empirical approach. Before we go down that road, I'd like to explore a few more things. Could we check for eosinophilia on a complete blood count (CBC)? That might give us a clue about an underlying allergic or inflammatory process. Also, given the six-month duration, has the patient been evaluated by an ENT? Something like vocal cord dysfunction or a subtle anatomical abnormality could be contributing."

Also, with the ENT referral, should we provide specific instructions to look for vocal cord dysfunction or any laryngeal abnormalities? I'm also wondering about environmental factors we might have missed. While the patient reports a clean home environment, could there be something more subtle, like exposure to irritants at work or during hobbies?

While less common in IVLBCL than other lymphomas, it's worth investigating given the systemic inflammation.

These can sometimes mimic lymphoma presentations, especially with prominent cutaneous involvement. Additionally, while the patient denies travel history, it might be worth revisiting this point and inquiring about any potential exposures to ticks or insect bites, given the possibility of tick-borne illnesses.

This, along with the ferritin, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and soluble IL-2 receptor levels, will help solidify or rule out HLH. While anaplastic features would point towards a more aggressive lymphoma, the absence of B symptoms besides the fever is somewhat unusual.

Before we proceed with those, I have a couple of clarifying questions. First, regarding the dyspnea, is it specifically related to exertion, or does she experience it at rest as well? This might help differentiate between cardiac/pulmonary causes and a more GI-focused etiology. Second, has she been screened for anemia?

I'll ask her specifically if the breathlessness precedes the feeling of fullness, or vice-versa. It's possible that the exertion of eating itself, even small amounts, could be triggering the dyspnea, making her *feel* full when it's actually respiratory distress. I also wanted to revisit the possibility of a motility disorder affecting other parts of the GI tract besides the stomach. While gastroparesis is a key consideration, could the symptoms also be explained by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)? The bloating and fullness are consistent with SIBO, and while it doesn't typically cause dyspnea directly, the discomfort and distension could potentially restrict diaphragmatic movement, contributing to shortness of breath.

Given that her pelvic ultrasound was normal and she doesn't report any pelvic pain or bowel/bladder changes, it seemed less likely, but I can certainly see how it could contribute to the bloating and pressure sensation. I'll add that to my list of questions for the patient. Before we wrap up, I have a few more thoughts.

The patient exhibits the classic CREST features: Calcinosis isn't explicitly mentioned, but the \"bumpy, firm, greasy-looking spots\" on the face could represent calcinosis cutis. She has Raynaud's phenomenon (color changes in the fingers with cold), esophageal dysmotility (difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, nocturnal heartburn), sclerodactyly (thickened skin on hands and fingers with difficulty straightening them), and telangiectasias (described as a reddish bumpy rash on the face, nose, lips, ears, trunk, and feet).

I agree that a ligamentous injury is less probable given the chronic nature and absence of reported instability, but I want to be thorough. Since the injury occurred while exiting an auto-rickshaw, it's possible there was a twisting component that wasn't clearly articulated in the history. Therefore, I'll specifically ask the patient about any twisting or rotational force during the injury. Given the patient's renal issues requiring dialysis, I'm also mindful of potential secondary effects on musculoskeletal health. Could the patient's underlying medical condition be contributing to the chronic knee issues, perhaps through metabolic bone disease or soft tissue changes?

We've requested a herpes zoster antibody blood test to confirm. My primary concern at this point, given her type 2 diabetes, is the potential for complications. While her diabetes doesn't seem poorly controlled enough to cause significant immunosuppression, it does increase her risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Also, are there any other dermatological conditions we should consider in the differential, given the chronicity of the rash?

I will inquire about that immediately. I also agree with the recommendation for a high-resolution CT scan of the chest. This will help us visualize the lung parenchyma more clearly and look for the characteristic ground-glass opacities, nodules, and mosaic attenuation patterns often seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also a good suggestion. The BAL fluid analysis, particularly the lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, can provide further evidence supporting the diagnosis.

I'm referring this patient due to progressive vision dimming, predominantly in low light, coupled with unusual crescent-shaped indentations in their lower eyelids. They also report a few stumbles and a fall recently. While their bloodwork, including vitamin A levels, came back normal, I'm still suspicious of a possible vitamin A deficiency, especially given their reported suboptimal intake of vitamin A-rich foods. The patient has a history of keratoconus and corneal transplants about 15 years ago, but reports no complications related to the transplants. My primary concern is the combination of night blindness and the eyelid changes. While the bloodwork doesn't definitively point to a deficiency, I'm wondering if a more specialized ophthalmologic exam might reveal subtle signs not picked up by standard blood tests.

Are there any other lab tests that might help differentiate between warm and cold agglutinin disease, besides the cold agglutinin test which was negative in this case?"

It might be worth a trial of PPI therapy to see if there's any improvement in his hoarseness. Also, while he denies significant voice use, could his COPD be causing him to strain his voice more than he realizes? Perhaps he's unconsciously altering his breathing or phonation due to his underlying lung disease. Finally, has he had any recent unintentional weight loss?

I'll specifically inquire about NSAIDs, antibiotics, and psychotropics, given their association with fixed drug eruption. It's helpful to know the lesion location in fixed drug eruption can vary slightly within a region. Regarding Beh\u00e7et's, I'll ask about mouth sores, eye inflammation (like uveitis or iritis), and joint pain. Are there any other symptoms associated with Beh\u00e7et's that I should inquire about, perhaps skin manifestations elsewhere on the body, or neurological symptoms? Given that we're broadening the differential, should we also consider other conditions like erythema multiforme, or even a less common infection like lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), despite the negative syphilis test? While LGV typically presents with a different ulcer characteristic, I want to ensure we're being comprehensive."

I'll also inquire about recent infections, particularly HSV (even though the test was negative, it could be a false negative or a recent exposure), and any medication use, including over-the-counter drugs, to consider erythema multiforme. For Beh\u00e7et's, I'll add questions about blood clots and neurological symptoms to the list that includes mouth sores, eye inflammation, and joint pain. Before I speak with the patient again, I want to clarify a few things regarding the biopsy. Given the lesions resolve and recur, should I aim to biopsy an active lesion, or would a biopsy of healed skin in a previously affected area still be informative? Also, are there any specific stains or special studies you would recommend for the biopsy specimen, given our expanded differential diagnosis"

While the initial symptoms and location suggested a possible STI, the negative STI tests, the recurring nature of the sores in different locations on the penis, the apparent link to trimming, and the description of the sores evolving from bumps to open sores that scab over strongly suggest a dermatological issue. The doctor is now suspecting folliculitis or pseudofolliculitis barbae, both of which fall under the purview of a dermatologist. A dermatologist can properly diagnose the skin condition and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include topical or oral medications, changes in grooming habits, or other interventions."
