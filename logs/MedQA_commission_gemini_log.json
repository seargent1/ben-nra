This is accompanied by diplopia, also fluctuating and worsening with activity. Additionally, the patient reports eyelid heaviness, particularly in the evenings, and some unsteadiness. The positive acetylcholine receptor antibody test strongly suggests myasthenia gravis. However, before we definitively conclude, I'd like to explore a few points. The patient mentioned some unsteadiness. Could this be ataxia, and if so, does it fit the typical presentation of MG? I'm also curious about the nature of the diplopia. Have we pinpointed which extraocular muscles are involved? This could help differentiate between a neuromuscular junction issue and something else within the brainstem.

A formal assessment of the extraocular muscles is an excellent suggestion, and I will schedule that promptly. I'll also order a single-fiber EMG to confirm neuromuscular junction dysfunction. While I also think LEMS is less likely given the positive AChR antibodies and the absence of autonomic symptoms typically seen in LEMS (like dry mouth or constipation), checking the LEMS antibody panel for completeness is a good idea to definitively rule it out. Could the mild temperature sensitivity the patient reported be relevant? I know some neuromuscular disorders can be exacerbated by heat. Is this something we should consider further, or is it likely unrelated?

Also, while we are pursuing the MG diagnosis aggressively, are there any other, less likely, differentials we should keep in mind at this stage, even with the positive AChR antibodies? I'm thinking particularly about other autoimmune conditions that might mimic some of the symptoms, or perhaps even a mitochondrial myopathy, although the fluctuating nature of the symptoms argues against that.

Would you suggest a specific myositis panel, or are the CK and rheumatology consult sufficient as an initial screen?

Specifically, are there any congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) that might present similarly to acquired MG, particularly with prominent ocular findings?

I'd like your opinion on this \u2013 have you seen cases with this pace of symptom development? Second, the patient denies any cognitive changes.

I understand PML prognosis is generally poor, but are there any specific factors, like JC virus subtype or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) risk, that we should be particularly mindful of in this context?

While the mother didn't specifically report currant jelly stools, the description of thicker, lighter colored stool could be consistent with early stages, and I wouldn't want to delay intervention based on the absence of that specific finding given the other concerning signs. I agree intussusception is the most likely diagnosis, but given the lack of vomiting, I'm also still slightly concerned about Hirschsprung's. Could we consider a rectal biopsy if the enema is unsuccessful or if there's any doubt about the diagnosis after the procedure? What are your thoughts on also ordering a basic metabolic panel to assess his electrolyte levels given the decreased intake and potential for dehydration?"

Could the abdominal symptoms be related to mesenteric lymph node involvement causing some obstruction or compression? Or could we be dealing with a primary GI lymphoma that has spread systemically? Also, while the patient denies any high-risk behaviors, I think an HIV test is still warranted, given the aggressive presentation.

My reasoning is twofold: first, obtaining tissue biopsies from the GI tract would allow for a more definitive assessment of involvement and potentially identify a primary GI lymphoma, even if the PET/CT is negative in that area. Second, if there *is* significant GI involvement, the biopsies could help determine if there are any complicating factors, such as perforation or obstruction, that might require more immediate intervention.

While the CBC is normal, that doesn't rule out AIN.

The X-ray was negative for fracture or dislocation, and we're awaiting the MRI results. My primary differential diagnoses are medial meniscus tear and MCL sprain. The mechanism of injury, location of pain, and aggravating factors fit with both. I'm also considering pes anserine bursitis, though the lack of localized swelling makes it less likely.

Also, while the valgus stress test was negative, could the mechanism of injury still suggest a low-grade MCL sprain that hasn't resulted in significant laxity? Given the combination of hip and knee findings, could we be looking at a combination of factors contributing to her pain?

We could then reassess her symptoms and consider the injection if she doesn't respond within the first 2-3 weeks of PT. My rationale is twofold: firstly, to avoid potential side effects of the injection, and secondly, to see if addressing the biomechanical issues alone provides sufficient relief. Also, given the negative McMurray's and the lack of effusion or other signs of a significant meniscus tear on the MRI, I'm less inclined to suspect a meniscal tear as a primary pain generator at this point.

The patient reports a transient loss of consciousness immediately after voiding, preceded by lightheadedness. The episode was brief, with no associated symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, or neurological deficits, and all initial tests (ECG, CBC, electrolytes, urinalysis) are normal. While the patient also reports occasional lightheadedness upon standing quickly, suggesting possible orthostatic hypotension, the timing of this particular syncopal episode so closely linked to urination makes micturition syncope the more likely diagnosis. My main questions for you are: 1. Do you agree with my initial assessment of micturition syncope as the most probable diagnosis? 2. Are there any further cardiac investigations you would recommend at this stage, given the normal ECG? I'm thinking specifically about a 24-hour"

The Holter monitor will help us capture any intermittent irregularities. I will also order orthostatic vital signs to quantify the degree of orthostatic hypotension, if present. Given the patient's age and otherwise normal workup, are there any other less common cardiac causes we should consider, even if they are low probability? For example, could there be an outflow obstruction issue that might be exacerbated by the Valsalva maneuver sometimes associated with urination? Should we consider a cardiac echo at this stage, or would you prefer to wait for the results of the Holter and orthostatic vitals?

Should we consider a neurological consult at any point? 2. Regarding the tilt-table test, are there any specific criteria or thresholds during the test that would influence our management or suggest a different diagnosis?

While the patient denies pain, nipple discharge, or skin changes, the rapid growth is a red flag. My primary concern is ruling out malignancy. My initial thoughts are that we need to determine the grade of this phyllodes tumor. The biopsy report doesn't specify whether it's benign, borderline, or malignant. Do you agree that this is the most pressing issue? What additional information from the pathology report would be helpful in assessing the risk of malignancy, such as mitotic rate or stromal atypia?

What are your thoughts on obtaining a breast MRI pre-operatively? Could this help better delineate the tumor margins and assess for any additional suspicious lesions we might have missed? Additionally, would you recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of excision, even in the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy, given the potential for malignancy? Finally, assuming the pathology comes back as malignant, what would be your recommended post-surgical surveillance protocol? I'm thinking regular physical exams, breast imaging, and possibly chest imaging given the potential for distant metastasis, though that's less common with phyllodes."

Regarding the pre-operative MRI, while I understand it may not change management in terms of the need for wide local excision, could it influence the *extent* of the excision? For example, if the MRI reveals the tumor is larger than initially estimated by palpation and mammography, or if it shows concerning features within the tumor itself, might that lead to a wider excision margin being taken intraoperatively?

Some studies suggest it can reduce local recurrence rates, particularly for larger tumors or close/positive margins. Would you consider it in this patient, pending final pathology, or do you generally reserve radiotherapy for cases with confirmed malignant features and/or incomplete resection? Also, while we're waiting for the additional pathology and MRI results, are there any other tumor markers or genetic tests you would recommend at this stage?

I'm thinking specifically about things like fibroadenoma with complex features, periductal stromal sarcoma, or even a metaplastic carcinoma, though the latter is less likely given the absence of epithelial components in the initial biopsy.

This patient presents with fever, lower abdominal tenderness, and a slightly musty lochia a few days postpartum after a difficult vaginal delivery of a large infant. My primary concern is postpartum endometritis. The prolonged labor, large baby, and vaginal delivery all increase the risk of infection. The fever, uterine tenderness, and lochia characteristics further support this diagnosis. However, we need to consider other possibilities. Given the frequent urination, a urinary tract infection (UTI) is also on the differential. While she denies dysuria, UTIs can sometimes present atypically in the postpartum period. Mastitis is less likely given the absence of breast-related symptoms and the localized abdominal tenderness. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, though rare, should also be considered given the fever and pelvic pain.

Or should we hold off on those until after the proctoscopy results, focusing on the more likely diagnoses first? Also, regarding the proctoscopy, should we consider biopsies at the time of the procedure, even if the findings appear consistent with hemorrhoids, given the persistent bleeding and the need to definitively rule out more serious conditions?

Orthopedic surgeons specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system, including dislocations, fractures, and soft tissue injuries. Managing a hip dislocation often requires specialized orthopedic expertise for reduction (putting the hip back in place) and potential surgical intervention if there are associated fractures or if the dislocation is unstable.

Given the mechanism of injury (rear-end collision), a dashboard impact with the right knee causing a posterior hip dislocation makes sense. A contralateral knee injury is less common in this scenario. I agree that bilateral knee X-rays are warranted to rule out occult fractures, patellar injuries, or even tibial plateau fractures, although the latter seems less likely without direct impact. I'll order those now. Do you think we should consider any other diagnoses at this point, beyond the posterior hip dislocation and potential knee injuries? Could the left knee tenderness be related to a ligamentous injury from bracing during the impact? While the patient hasn't reported any instability, it's something to keep in mind. Also, given the significant hip dislocation, should we be concerned about associated sciatic nerve injury?"

I'll ask the patient specifically about any \"popping\" sensation in either knee at the time of the impact to investigate potential ligamentous injury. Given the tenderness over both kneecaps, I'm leaning towards a contusion or patellar tendon strain as more likely than a ligamentous injury, especially in the left knee, but we'll see what the X-rays reveal.

Even if the right knee impacting the dashboard caused the hip dislocation and subsequent forces led to a potential injury in the left knee, the mechanism isn't entirely clear to me. Could the left knee tenderness simply be due to bracing against the floorboard during the impact, even without direct contact with any part of the car? Perhaps a strain of the quadriceps or patellar tendon on that side? Once we have the CT and knee X-ray results, we'll have a much clearer picture.

However, other potential diagnoses include meconium ileus, meconium plug syndrome, anorectal malformations, and less likely, intestinal atresia or stenosis.

The patient denies fever, chills, vomiting, recent travel, or unusual food intake. They are only taking levofloxacin and report decreased urine output and dark yellow urine, suggesting dehydration. My primary concern is *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI) given the antibiotic exposure, watery diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. While the lack of fever is somewhat atypical, it's not unheard of in CDI. Levofloxacin, while not a primary risk factor for CDI like clindamycin or cephalosporins, can still disrupt the gut flora and predispose to CDI.

Were there any signs of reflux or obstruction, even if they were below the threshold for a definitive diagnosis of venous insufficiency? Sometimes a technically adequate study can still miss subtle abnormalities. Secondly, given the negative Doppler, we need to broaden our differential. Could this be another type of ulcer, such as arterial, neuropathic, or even pyoderma gangrenosum? The patient's medication list includes insulin,"

If not, repeating the study in a standing position is definitely warranted. I agree that arterial disease needs to be excluded, and I'll order an ABI and pulse volume recordings. A referral to a vascular lab for a more comprehensive assessment, including perhaps a venous refill study, would also be beneficial. Given the patient's diabetes (indicated by the insulin prescription), I'm also wondering about the possibility of a neuropathic ulcer, even though the description of the ulcer and the pain doesn't perfectly fit that picture. Did the referring physician document a neurological exam of the lower extremities, including assessment of sensation and reflexes? This would help determine if neuropathy is contributing. While pyoderma gangrenosum is less likely given the absence of systemic symptoms and the relatively slow progression, it's worth keeping in mind."

Poorly controlled diabetes could certainly contribute to impaired wound healing and increase the risk of infection.

Even a brief conversation to explain the situation and obtain consent for a possible hysterectomy would be ideal. If he's too distressed, documenting the emergent nature of the situation and the inability to obtain full consent due to time constraints is important. 2. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics:** While you mentioned prophylactic antibiotics, given the potential for contamination from a ruptured uterus, should we consider starting with broad-spectrum coverage initially, then narrowing down based on intraoperative findings and cultures? 3. **Post-op pain management:** Given the potential for a hysterectomy and a complicated post-"

We have a recent onset of asymmetric inflammatory arthritis, primarily affecting the right knee, with a history of a similar episode in the left ankle. The accompanying urinary symptoms, including burning, frequency, and urgency, along with the elevated WBCs in the urinalysis, suggest a likely genitourinary infection, even though the urine culture was negative. The concurrent conjunctivitis further strengthens the case for reactive arthritis. While the patient denies any known STIs, and the HLA-B27 is negative, these don't rule out reactive arthritis. Chlamydia is a common trigger, and it can be asymptomatic, especially in women. The negative HLA-B27 is also not definitive, as a significant percentage of patients with reactive arthritis are HLA-B27 negative.

Importantly, the stool studies, including cultures, ova and parasites, and calprotectin, are normal. Colonoscopy was also normal. This makes inflammatory bowel disease less likely, although microscopic colitis remains a remote possibility given the mucus. The patient denies weight loss, blood in the stool, fever, or recent international travel. There was a camping trip a few months prior, and another camper reportedly had a recent illness, though the details are vague. The patient reports increased stress levels recently. My initial thoughts are that we should consider functional disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly IBS-D (diarrhea predominant). The normal colonoscopy and lack of inflammatory markers support this. The stress reported by the patient also points in this direction."

However, now that we've ruled out several other conditions, it's a reasonable next step. Before we conclude, I have a couple of other questions. First, while the patient denies blood in their stool, did the colonoscopy biopsies show any microscopic evidence of inflammation or other abnormalities?

Before we settle on post-infectious IBS or IBS-D as the primary diagnosis, are there any other less common conditions we should consider at this stage, given the negative findings so far? Things like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), or even a very rare parasitic infection that was missed on the initial stool testing? Should we consider a breath test for SIBO, or repeat the stool ova and parasites with a different laboratory, just to be absolutely thorough?

Before we conclude, I have a few final points to clarify: 1. **Regarding Viberzi and Xifaxan:** While these are good options for IBS-D, Viberzi has potential constipation as a side effect, which could be problematic given the patient's already altered bowel habits. With Xifaxan, while effective for SIBO, its utility in non-SIBO IBS-D, especially post-infectious IBS, is still being investigated.

We have a young woman presenting with new-onset shortness of breath, increasing abdominal girth, and orthopnea, all developing over the past month. An abdominal ultrasound reveals a large ovarian mass and significant ascites. The patient reports no weight loss, fever, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. Crucially, she states she was unaware of any previously diagnosed ovarian mass. My primary concern is ovarian cancer, given the rapid accumulation of ascites and the size of the mass. The lack of constitutional symptoms like weight loss or fever doesn't rule out malignancy, unfortunately. I'd like to get your thoughts on the differential diagnosis. While ovarian cancer is high on my list, what other possibilities should we consider? Could this be a benign ovarian process, such as a large benign cystic teratoma or a rapidly growing fibroma, complicated by torsion or hemorrhage leading to the ascites? Or could"

Less likely, but consider Meigs syndrome (benign ovarian fibroma with ascites and pleural effusion), or a rapidly growing benign tumor with secondary complications. Expediting a CA-125, along with other tumor markers like HE4, ROMA, and Inhibin A/B would be helpful."

Given the patient's age, I'm also wondering about the possibility of a germ cell tumor. While less common than epithelial ovarian cancer, they can present with rapid growth and ascites. Should we also consider adding AFP and beta-hCG to the tumor marker panel to evaluate for that possibility? Also, I'm concerned about the potential for malignant transformation in a previously undiagnosed benign mass. Could a previously asymptomatic dermoid cyst, for example, have undergone malignant transformation? Or could this be a borderline ovarian tumor that has progressed? In terms of next steps, beyond the tumor markers, I think a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be beneficial. This would help us assess the extent of the ascites, look for any pleural effusions (which would further support Meigs"

Given the urgency, I've already made the referral to you and we've secured a slot for her next week. Before we conclude, I have a couple of final thoughts. Firstly, while surgical exploration is definitely the definitive next step for diagnosis and potential debulking, I'm slightly apprehensive about the rapid accumulation of ascites. Would you consider a paracentesis before surgery, both for symptomatic relief and for cytology? It could give us a quicker, albeit less comprehensive, look at the cellular makeup of the fluid and potentially expedite diagnosis. Secondly, given the patient's young age and the possibility of a germ cell tumor, should we be considering fertility-sparing surgery if feasible? Obviously, this depends on the final diagnosis and staging, but I wanted to raise it now so"

I'll also ensure the patient understands that fertility-sparing surgery is a possibility, though dependent on the final diagnosis and staging. Given the rapid onset of symptoms and the large volume of ascites, I'm still leaning towards malignancy, likely ovarian. However, I want to make sure we're considering all possibilities. With Meigs syndrome, the pleural effusion is a key component. While the CT scan will assess for this, should we also consider a chest x-ray now, given her orthopnea, to more quickly assess for pleural involvement and potentially quantify the degree of effusion if present? It could help with prioritizing the paracentesis if there's significant respiratory compromise from a large effusion. Also, while less common, could this presentation be consistent with a Krukenberg tumor?"

Regarding Krukenberg, I agree it's less likely given the apparent primary ovarian mass. However, given the rapid progression, I want to be thorough. Should we consider adding a CT of the upper abdomen, specifically looking at the stomach, pancreas, and biliary tree, to the imaging workup? While unlikely, a primary GI malignancy with ovarian metastasis could present similarly. Also, while we've discussed several benign and malignant possibilities, I'm curious about your thoughts on pseudomyxoma peritonei, albeit a rare entity. Could the ascites be mucinous in nature? While it typically presents with more insidious onset, the rapid accumulation in this case makes me wonder. Would you consider"
