Most likely diagnosis: **Exogenous ochronosis**. This is supported by the bluish-brown discoloration, primarily on sun-exposed areas of the face, worsening with long-term hydroquinone use. The patient's description of initial improvement followed by worsening pigmentation, along with the underlying redness and visible capillaries, further points towards this diagnosis. While other conditions like melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are possible, the prolonged hydroquinone use makes exogenous ochronosis the most likely culprit.

The patient's use of a hydroquinone cream for an extended period, the worsening of the condition despite initial improvement, and the specific description of the discoloration strongly suggest a diagnosis related to skin pigmentation changes, possibly exogenous ochronosis.

While the patient couldn\u2019t recall the specific brand, the two-year continuous usage of an over-the-counter hydroquinone cream raises a red flag. Many OTC formulations, especially those acquired outside of regulated pharmacies, may contain higher concentrations of hydroquinone or include other ingredients that increase the risk of ochronosis. My primary differential diagnoses include: * **Exogenous Ochronosis:** As mentioned, this is my top suspicion. The clinical presentation aligns well, and the history of hydroquinone use makes it highly probable. * **Melasma:** While melasma can cause similar hyperpigmentation, it typically presents as more brownish patches and is often associated with hormonal changes. The patient denied any such changes,"

Do you think a series of superficial glycolic acid peels might be a safer initial approach? We could then consider TCA peels later if the response is inadequate. Also, I\u2019d like to discuss the possibility of adding a topical antioxidant, such as vitamin C serum, to the regimen.

Firstly, given the patient's history of using a hydroquinone cream from a non-regulated source, I'm concerned about the possibility of other potentially harmful ingredients like mercury or corticosteroids being present. While the biopsy will help identify ochronosis, it might not reveal the presence of these other ingredients. Would you recommend any specific tests to screen for these, perhaps as part of the biopsy analysis or separately? Secondly, I'd like to discuss the patient's sun protection habits further. While they report limited sun exposure and using sunscreen occasionally, I think reinforcing strict sun avoidance and daily sunscreen application with a broad-spectrum SPF of 30 or higher is crucial, regardless of the final diagnosis. We should also counsel them on the importance of seeking shade and wearing protective clothing. Do"

Regarding the biopsy, besides confirming exogenous ochronosis and ruling out other pigmentary disorders like melasma and lichenoid dermatosis, are there any other specific stains or analyses we should consider? For instance, would a Fontana-Masson stain be helpful in visualizing the ochronotic pigment and further supporting the diagnosis? Also, considering the patient's initial response to the hydroquinone cream, albeit temporary, I'm wondering if there might be a component of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation contributing to the current presentation. Could the initial inflammation triggered by the hydroquinone, perhaps exacerbated by other ingredients in the cream, have played a role in the subsequent darkening? If so"

While the lack of other systemic symptoms makes it less likely, it's definitely worth investigating. Regarding the PPI trial, what duration would you recommend? Two weeks? Four weeks?

Necrobiosis lipoidica, while a skin manifestation, can be a cutaneous marker of diabetes. An endocrinologist specializes in hormonal disorders and metabolic issues, including diabetes. They are best equipped to interpret the blood sugar tests, assess the patient's overall metabolic health, and manage any potential underlying diabetic condition contributing to the skin issue. A dermatologist can collaborate on the topical treatment of the skin lesions, but the endocrinologist should lead the management if a hormonal/metabolic component is suspected."

However, the chest x-ray revealed circumferential pericardial calcification and pleural effusions, shifting my suspicion towards constrictive pericarditis. The patient denies any history of chest pain, which is somewhat atypical, but not unheard of in constrictive pericarditis. They also deny any known history of TB exposure.

Given the patient's history and these findings, I'm less inclined to think it's congestive heart failure, although the symptoms initially pointed in that direction. Do you concur with this assessment?

Interestingly, the initial antibody panel (ANA, anti-Scl-70, anti-centromere), inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and skin biopsy all returned normal. My primary concern, given the constellation of symptoms, was scleroderma, specifically diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. However, the negative serology and biopsy make that less likely.

However, the progressive tightening of the fingers and the dysphagia certainly fit. I agree that a deep biopsy including fascia and an eosinophil count are the next logical steps.

More importantly, the bronchoalveolar lavage showed a marked eosinophilia (74%), shifting the focus towards eosinophilic lung diseases. My primary concern is eosinophilic pneumonia, but we've been systematically trying to rule out various causes. We've investigated common allergens (Aspergillus, Coccidioides) with negative results.

The delay in getting these basic labs back is hindering our progress.

Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, should we also be considering parasitic infections more strongly, even though we haven't received the stool O&P results yet? Would you recommend ordering serology for specific parasites, or should we wait for the stool results first? Also, while the chest CT showed upper lobe predominance, the distribution was peripheral and subpleural. Does this pattern fit with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, or does it raise any other diagnostic possibilities in your mind?

Also, while we're waiting, I'll thoroughly review the patient's social and environmental history again, focusing on potential exposures related to hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

I'm wondering about a few things. First, what were your findings on the complete eye exam, specifically regarding visual acuity, visual fields, and a detailed examination of the anterior and posterior segments? Did you notice any optic nerve pallor or abnormalities of the retina?

He's clearly benefiting from the inhaled corticosteroid, but it seems to have predisposed him to this fungal infection. Do you have any recommendations for balancing the need for COPD control with the risk of recurrent laryngeal candidiasis? Are there alternative COPD medications we should consider?

Could we consider a step-wise approach? First, optimize the inhaled corticosteroid technique with the spacer and oral hygiene. If the infection recurs, we could then try a short course of antifungal treatment alongside continued inhaled steroid use with the optimized technique. If *that* fails, then we consider switching to a LABA/LAMA. Does that seem reasonable?

However, the biopsy findings of acantholysis and multinucleated giant cells raise a strong suspicion for Herpes Zoster (shingles), specifically affecting the genital area. While less common than HSV in this location, it's certainly possible. The patient's HIV status, even if managed with medication, adds another layer of complexity as it can increase the risk of HZ reactivation. My primary concern now is differentiating between HSV and HZ. While the PCR would have been ideal, it's unavailable. I have a few questions: 1. Could you describe the distribution of the lesions? Were they clustered or scattered? HZ tends to follow a dermatomal distribution. 2. Was there any associated pain with the lesions, beyond the initial itching? HZ often presents with significant neuralgic pain. 3."

I also wanted to clarify a few points based on your recommendations and my ongoing review of the case: 1. **Regarding the distribution:** While a dermatomal distribution strongly favors HZ, could HSV lesions ever mimic this pattern, especially in the genital area where dermatomes can be less distinct? I'm wondering if the perceived clustering could be due to the moist environment and close proximity of tissues. 2. **Pain:** The patient reported itching prior to the sores, but denied other pain. However, could the patient's underlying HIV infection and potential immunodeficiency influence the typical pain presentation of HZ? Could it be less severe or atypical? 3. **Acantholytic cells:** While acantholysis is a hallmark of HZ, isn't it also seen in other conditions like Pemphigus vulgaris? Although PV is typically more"

Immunocompromised patients may have atypical HZ presentations, including less pain.

Consider a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test on a lesion biopsy if available to confirm HZ."

I agree that Pemphigus Vulgaris is less likely given the multinucleated giant cells. I will inquire about the availability of a DFA test on the biopsy sample. Given the leaning towards HZ, I also want to explore a few other aspects: 1. **Antiviral treatment:** Has the patient received any antiviral treatment in the past, either for this recurring issue or for other infections? If so, which medications and what was the response? This could offer clues about the nature of the infection. A good response to acyclovir, for example, wouldn't necessarily rule out HZ but might favor HSV. 2. **Lesion morphology:** While we have the biopsy findings, I'd like to get a more detailed description of the individual lesions. Were they vesicles (fluid-filled blisters) initially?"

Given our strong suspicion of HZ, even with the atypical presentation, I'd like to consider the implications for management. If we presume it is HZ, should we consider antiviral therapy even though the lesions have resolved for now? Given his HIV status, would suppressive therapy be warranted to prevent recurrences? What would be the recommended antiviral regimen in this context, considering potential drug interactions with his HIV medications? Also, while less likely, we haven't completely ruled out HSV. If the DFA is negative for HZ, and assuming a past HSV test is also negative, would you recommend a type-specific HSV serology? This could help clarify if a subclinical or atypical HSV infection is contributing to the recurrent lesions. Finally,"
