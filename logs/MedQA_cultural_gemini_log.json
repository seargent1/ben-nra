The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis (MG), including fluctuating muscle weakness, particularly affecting the proximal muscles (difficulty climbing stairs, upper limb weakness, difficulty brushing hair), diplopia that worsens with sustained upward gaze and in the evenings, and bulbar symptoms such as dysarthria and difficulty chewing. The positive acetylcholine receptor antibody test strongly supports this diagnosis. My initial workup included a CBC, CMP, and thyroid panel, all of which returned normal, ruling out some metabolic or endocrine causes for the weakness. A chest CT has been ordered to assess for thymoma, given the association with MG. Before we discuss management, I wanted to clarify a few points and get your expert opinion. The patient reported no shortness of breath or bowel/bladder dysfunction, which is reassuring. However, the notes mention heavy eyelids.

I didn't observe definitive ptosis during my examination, but the patient did report heavy eyelids, particularly in the evenings, which could be subtle ptosis. Given the positive AChR antibodies and the characteristic fluctuating weakness, I'm fairly confident in the MG diagnosis. However, I'd be interested in your thoughts on other potential neuromuscular junction disorders, like Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). While the patient's symptoms are more aligned with MG, the absence of autonomic symptoms doesn't definitively rule out LEMS. Could you comment on the likelihood of LEMS in this case, and whether"

The chest CT has already been ordered to evaluate for a thymoma. Given the patient's age, I'd like to also consider other, albeit less likely, differentials. Could we discuss the possibility of mitochondrial myopathies? While the fluctuating nature of the symptoms fits MG well, some mitochondrial disorders can present with similar patterns of weakness, particularly involving the extraocular and bulbar muscles. Are there any specific mitochondrial panels you would recommend considering, or would you consider this a lower priority given the positive AChR antibodies?

Also, regarding the EMG/RNS, are there any specific muscles you would recommend targeting for these studies, given the patient's presentation of proximal limb weakness, ocular symptoms, and bulbar involvement?

This will help confirm the diagnosis of PML and assess the viral load. Doctor: Finally, have you experienced any other neurological symptoms besides the gait and limb ataxia and right arm weakness, such as difficulty with speech, swallowing, or vision changes?"

The initial MRI findings suggested Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), particularly given the patient's Crohn's disease and treatment with natalizumab, a known risk factor for PML. However, both the JC virus antibody test and the CSF PCR for JC virus DNA came back negative. This throws the initial diagnosis into question. My primary concern is the discrepancy between the MRI findings and the negative JC virus tests. While the MRI showed lesions consistent with PML, the absence of the virus makes that diagnosis highly unlikely. Therefore, we need to consider other differential diagnoses.

Are there any specific MRI features that could help distinguish between these possibilities? 2.

Given the acute onset of symptoms, I'm wondering if there could be another contributing factor, perhaps something superimposed on a chronic, previously undiagnosed, mild form of Hirschsprung's. Could the acute presentation be due to something like an enterocolitis complicating Hirschsprung's, or perhaps a volvulus?

The reported splenomegaly on physical exam isn't reflected in the imaging, which is also odd. I'm wondering if we should consider other abdominal pathologies, even concurrent with the lymphoma.

Yes, a bone marrow biopsy was performed and was thankfully normal. This helps with staging and prognostication. My primary concern is the disconnect between the clinical picture and the imaging findings.

Regarding celiac disease, while the patient's symptoms could potentially overlap, the lymphadenopathy and confirmed DLBCL make it a less probable primary driver of the presentation. However, it's certainly worth checking the tTG-IgA to rule out any contributing or concurrent celiac disease, which could impact nutritional status and overall management.

However, the patient describes the pain as being *below* the kneecap, which is atypical for an MCL sprain. This makes me consider other possibilities. My differential diagnosis includes: * **MCL Sprain:** Most likely given the mechanism and medial pain. However, the location below the kneecap is not typical. * **Medial Meniscus Tear:** Also possible with twisting injuries. The location of pain fits better, and meniscus tears can sometimes present without significant effusion initially. * **Pes Anserine Bursitis:** This can"

Given the negative valgus stress test and lack of localized tenderness over the pes anserine bursa, I'm now leaning more towards a medial meniscus tear. Did the patient mention any clicking or locking of the knee? Also, what's your opinion on ordering a McMurray's test to further assess for a meniscus tear while we wait for the MRI?

For example, if the urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria, it might prompt further evaluation for urological issues, regardless of its connection to the syncope.

I also agree with the chromosomal microarray and brain MRI if hypotonia persists after the neurology assessment. Would you also consider an EEG at that stage, especially given the decreased activity and muted responses? Could there be a subtle seizure disorder contributing to the clinical picture? Finally, while we're discussing further testing, should we consider testing for other congenital infections given the hearing impairment, even though the CBC was normal? Toxoplasmosis and rubella come to mind, although I acknowledge they are less likely. Would you recommend adding those to the infectious workup, or would you prefer to wait and see what the CMV results show first? I'm trying to balance thoroughness with avoiding unnecessary testing."

One final question \u2013 given the combination of potential cataracts, hearing impairment, and the possibility of congenital CMV, should we also be considering a referral to genetics for evaluation and counseling, even at this early stage?

My primary concern is postpartum endometritis. Given the vaginal delivery and prolonged labor, the uterine lining is at increased risk of infection. The fever, chills, and abdominal tenderness all point in that direction, and the foul-smelling lochia further strengthens the suspicion. While we're waiting on the CBC, urinalysis, and blood cultures, I'm also considering other possibilities in the differential.

Would you recommend obtaining additional cultures, such as vaginal or endometrial cultures, to help guide antibiotic therapy?

For example, could she have both endometritis and a UTI, even with minimal urinary symptoms? Or perhaps endometritis and a breast infection?

I'm curious, given the patient's age and the localized nature of the EEG findings to the temporal lobe, what specific structural abnormalities would you be most concerned about on the MRI, aside from the obvious like a tumor? Mesial temporal sclerosis, as you mentioned earlier, certainly comes to mind. Anything else we should be looking for specifically? Also, while I agree that transient global amnesia is less likely, the patient's description of the post-ictal confusion lasting about an hour is a bit longer than I typically see with focal seizures.

Regarding frontal lobe involvement, the reaching movements described by the brother are somewhat ambiguous. Could you clarify what would constitute \"reaching\" movements suggestive of frontal lobe involvement versus those more typical of temporal lobe seizures? I'm trying to gauge whether additional investigation into frontal lobe function is warranted, perhaps with neuropsychological testing. The extended post-ictal period is still nagging at me. While it could be part of a complex seizure, it seems disproportionately long relative to the brief ictal period of only a few minutes. Are there any other less common epilepsies or seizure variants we should be considering that might present with this pattern of a brief seizure followed by prolonged confusion?

However, the prolonged post-ictal confusion still raises a flag for me. While non-convulsive status epilepticus is less likely given the interictal EEG, could the prolonged confusion be a postictal manifestation itself, perhaps related to transient dysfunction in a network connected to the temporal lobe, rather than ongoing seizure activity? Given the atypical aura and this prolonged confusion, before we proceed with the video EEG, I'd like to explore one more avenue. Could we consider a referral for neuropsychological testing to assess for any subtle cognitive deficits, particularly in memory and executive function, which might be related to the affected temporal lobe or potentially point towards a more diffuse process?

The distension has worsened since birth, and there were no reported complications during the pregnancy or family history of GI disorders. Given the clinical picture, I suspected a distal bowel obstruction and ordered an abdominal x-ray and a contrast enema. The x-ray showed dilated bowel loops with no gas in the rectum. Following this, a rectal biopsy was performed which revealed an absence of ganglion cells, confirming the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.

Given the bilious vomiting and distal obstruction, meconium ileus and intestinal atresia were on the differential, though the absence of meconium on rectal exam and the normal prenatal ultrasounds made these less probable.

The absence of fracture or dislocation on x-ray further supports this. My primary differential diagnosis at this point is a mallet finger, likely involving a tendon injury \u2013 either a partial tear of the extensor tendon or an avulsion fracture at the base of the distal phalanx, which can sometimes be difficult to see on plain x-rays.

Your suggestion of repeat x-rays in a week is excellent, especially to monitor for any displacement if the splint doesn't maintain reduction. Before we finalize the plan, I have a couple of questions. First, given the patient reported a \"pop\" and significant pain at the time of injury, should we consider an ultrasound to assess the extensor tendon for a complete rupture? While less common, a complete rupture might require surgical intervention, and early assessment could be beneficial. Second, what are your thoughts on the use of a Stack splint versus a volar splint? Are there any patient factors that might influence your choice? This patient is a young, active individual, so compliance and comfort are key considerations. Finally,"

A thermoplastic splint sounds like a good option for him given his activity level. Regarding the potential for a small avulsion fracture, if the repeat x-ray in a week *does* show a small avulsion fracture, how would that change our management?

The initial and subsequent biopsies support this diagnosis, showing neutrophilic infiltration without evidence of infection. The patient's slightly elevated blood glucose and increased thirst also warrant further investigation, although they don't directly impact the likely PG diagnosis. I've already ordered a venous Doppler ultrasound to rule out venous insufficiency as a contributing factor to the ulceration, given the patient's leg swelling and visible varicose veins.

Given this finding, I'm considering a combined approach to treatment. My plan is to start the patient on systemic corticosteroids, likely prednisone, to address the PG. Topical corticosteroids are generally not effective for PG and could potentially worsen the ulcer. In addition to the systemic steroids, I plan to address the venous insufficiency with compression therapy. My questions for you are: 1. Do you agree with the combined approach of systemic corticosteroids and compression therapy in this case? 2.

However, since it could potentially address both conditions, it's definitely worth considering. Before we make a final decision on infliximab, I'd like to get your opinion on a few things: 1. Given the venous insufficiency, should we wait to see the response to compression therapy and systemic corticosteroids before escalating to infliximab? Perhaps the ulcer will respond well to this initial, less aggressive approach. 2. Are there any specific monitoring parameters you recommend for patients on infliximab, besides the standard CBC and liver function tests? I'"

Along with this, we'll initiate compression therapy with appropriate bandaging. My remaining questions are: 1.

Just to confirm my understanding and ensure we've covered all bases, I have a couple of final questions: 1. Given the presence of venous insufficiency, should we consider adding a venoactive drug like pentoxifylline to the treatment regimen? Could this potentially improve microcirculation and aid in ulcer healing? 2. While the biopsies have been consistent with PG, and the clinical picture strongly suggests it, are there any other less common differential diagnoses we should keep in mind, even if remote, that might mimic PG in a patient with Crohn's?

My initial differential included placental abruption given the pain and bleeding, but the tearing nature of the pain and the ultrasound findings solidified the diagnosis of uterine rupture. I have a few questions for you: 1. Do you agree with the diagnosis of uterine rupture? 2. The patient reported decreased fetal movement after the onset of pain. While the ultrasound confirmed the rupture, it didn't specifically comment on fetal status. What are your thoughts on the potential implications of the decreased fetal movement in this context? 3.

While less common with low transverse incisions compared to classical incisions, the rupture still occurred. 1. Do you think the ultrasound provided enough information to determine if this is a complete or incomplete rupture? 2. Should we anticipate significant hemoperitoneum given the reported blood loss and the ultrasound findings? I'm concerned about the patient's hemodynamic stability during the surgery. 3.

Given the patient's relatively stable vital signs at present, should we consider any additional rapid assessments or interventions before proceeding to the OR, such as a quick bedside ultrasound to assess the extent of the hemoperitoneum or placing a central line for more aggressive fluid resuscitation? 2. While rare, uterine rupture can sometimes be associated with underlying uterine anomalies. Should we consider this possibility, and if so, how would that influence our surgical approach? 3.

Regarding the hysterectomy decision, you mentioned extensive tissue damage, uterine artery involvement, and infection as factors favoring hysterectomy. Could you elaborate on what constitutes \"extensive tissue damage\" in this context? Is there a specific amount of uterine wall involvement, or type of tearing, that would make repair too risky or unlikely to be successful? Also, how do we best assess uterine artery involvement intraoperatively? Is it primarily through direct visualization and palpation, or are there other techniques we should consider? Finally, while infection seems less likely in this acute setting, what subtle signs should we be looking for that might suggest an underlying, perhaps low-grade, infection contributing to the rupture?"

Just a couple more questions to solidify my understanding: 1. Regarding uterine friability, are there any specific intraoperative tests or maneuvers, beyond visual inspection and palpation, that can help assess the degree of friability and thus inform the decision for hysterectomy? For example, would attempting a small test suture in a less compromised area of the uterus be helpful in gauging the tissue integrity? 2.

To ensure we're covering all bases, I have a couple more questions: 1. **Given his activity level and the mechanism of injury (squatting), should we consider incorporating core strengthening exercises into his PT regimen early on, or would that risk exacerbating the pain?** I'm thinking that addressing any underlying core weakness could be beneficial for long-term prevention, but I want to be cautious in the acute phase. 2. **Are there any specific red flags we should be monitoring for during the conservative management period that would warrant an earlier neurosurgical referral?** While cauda equina is less likely, I want to be vigilant. Should we be specifically asking about saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder changes at each follow-up, or are there other signs we should watch for"

I'm concerned about this patient presenting with what appears to be a migratory oligoarthritis, along with eye irritation and urinary symptoms. The timeline suggests the urinary symptoms preceded the joint involvement, starting a few weeks prior. The left ankle was affected initially, followed by the right knee, which is now the primary site of inflammation. The patient also reports conjunctivitis. This constellation of symptoms, combined with the elevated WBC and inflammatory markers (ESR 38, synovial fluid leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance), strongly suggests reactive arthritis. My initial suspicion was triggered by the classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis. However, the STI testing for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea wasn't performed, which is crucial for confirming a common trigger of reactive arthritis. The patient denies any recent gastrointestinal symptoms, which makes enteric infections like Salmonella or Shigella less likely as causative agents."

Regarding Celiac disease, while the lack of weight loss makes it less probable, could the chronic diarrhea itself, even without significant weight loss, be a sufficient indicator to warrant at least a basic Celiac screening, perhaps with a tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) test? It might be a low-yield test, but relatively easy to perform. Also, given the patient\u2019s report of another individual on the camping trip experiencing similar symptoms, should we consider advising the patient to inform their camping companion about the possibility of Giardia and suggest they get tested as well? This could provide further epidemiological support for a parasitic infection if they test positive."
