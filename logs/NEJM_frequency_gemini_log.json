I'm concerned about the development of exogenous ochronosis given the patient's history of hydroquinone use for two years and subsequent progressive darkening of the skin, especially since she noted it started *after* a year of using the cream. The bluish-brown discoloration, thickening, and distribution on sun-exposed areas are highly suggestive. The fact that it started as faint brown macules and progressed to darker, larger patches further strengthens this suspicion. While melasma was my initial thought, the timing related to the hydroquinone use makes ochronosis more likely. My main questions for you are: 1. Do you agree with exogenous ochronosis as the most likely diagnosis based on the information we have? 2. What other conditions, if any, should we consider in the differential diagnosis at this point? 3. Besides the biopsy, are there any other diagnostic tests you would recommend?

Regarding the differentials you mentioned: 1. **Drug-induced pigmentation:** While the patient only reported using the hydroquinone cream and a multivitamin, could you elaborate on what other specific medications are known to cause similar pigmentation patterns? Knowing this will help me review her medication history more thoroughly, even for over-the-counter drugs she might not have considered significant. 2. **Riehl's melanosis:** I understand this is also associated with chemical exposure.

Given that she mentioned using the hydroquinone cream for two years, and the pigmentation changes began after a year of use, the timeline strongly points towards exogenous ochronosis. However, exploring these other avenues will help us be thorough. Before we proceed with the biopsy and Wood's lamp examination, I'd like to clarify a few points regarding Riehl's melanosis. While chemical exposure is a key factor, I understand it's often associated with a more reticular or diffuse pigmentation pattern, sometimes with a slight erythema.

Besides pesticides and fertilizers, are there any other specific chemicals used in gardening that are known to cause photosensitivity and could contribute to Riehl's melanosis? I'm thinking of things like plant oils, certain types of mulch, or even specific plant species she might be handling. Also, to further differentiate between the two, I'd like to ask the patient about the specific evolution of the pigmentation. Did it start as more of a diffuse darkening and then become patchy, or was it patchy from the outset?

While not diagnostic, elevated ACE levels are often seen in sarcoidosis and can be helpful in supporting the diagnosis. Vitamin D levels can also be elevated, and it's important to know this for management. Secondly, regarding the ophthalmology referral, are there any specific ocular symptoms the patient is experiencing? While I understand the importance of screening for ocular involvement, knowing if there are any existing symptoms like blurred vision, redness, or pain might"

Given the patient's relatively mild presentation with just a persistent cough, I'm leaning towards a less aggressive initial management approach. While Rheumatology referral is certainly warranted for long-term management and in cases with significant organ involvement, I'd like to observe the patient's response to a short course of corticosteroids before making that referral. What are your thoughts on starting a low dose of prednisone, say 20mg daily for 4-6 weeks, and then re-evaluating with repeat pulmonary function tests and a chest x-ray? We can then decide on the Rheumatology referral based on the response to treatment and the presence or absence of extrapulmonary manifestations. Also, would you recommend"

A slow taper is generally recommended to avoid relapse, but I wanted to get your specific input. 2. While the crazy paving pattern on the HRCT is suggestive of sarcoidosis, it can also be seen in other conditions like hypersensitivity pneumonitis, although the lack of exposure history makes that less likely.

Notably, the patient denies weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy. The skin biopsy shows intravascular aggregates of atypical lymphocytes positive for CD20, PAX-5, and MUM-1, confirming B-cell lymphoma. The dramatically elevated LDH further supports this, and points towards a high tumor burden and aggressive disease. Given the presentation and biopsy findings, the diagnosis of Intravascular Large B-cell Lymphoma (IVLBCL) seems fairly straightforward. However, I have a few questions and thoughts: 1. While the patient denies neurological symptoms currently, IVLBCL has a predilection for CNS involvement. Has a brain MRI been considered to assess for this, even in the absence of overt symptoms? This is crucial for staging and treatment planning."

While bone marrow involvement isn't as common in IVLBCL as in other lymphomas, it's certainly possible and important to assess. I'll add that to the list. Given the aggressive nature of this disease and the already high LDH, I'm concerned about the patient's overall performance status. Have you had any thoughts on how we should approach initial therapy? Are we thinking R-CHOP-like regimens, or something more intensive given the potential for CNS involvement? Also, given the rarity of IVLBCL, would you recommend referral to a center with more experience in managing this specific subtype?"

I'll also schedule a baseline ophthalmologic exam to assess for retinal involvement, as you suggested. Given the patient's relatively young age (implied by their active sexual history inquiry) and the aggressive nature of this lymphoma, I'm wondering if we should consider germline mutation testing. While it's less common in IVLBCL than some other lymphoma subtypes, it could still be relevant for long-term prognosis and family counseling if positive. Also, while we're discussing additional testing, should we consider testing for other infections, like EBV, CMV, or HHV-8, given the initial presentation with fever and skin lesions?

One more question regarding the treatment strategy: While dose-adjusted EPOCH-R seems like a strong contender, I'm also considering the potential benefits of adding intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis, given the propensity of IVLBCL for CNS involvement. Even with rituximab, microscopic CNS disease could be present, and early intervention might improve outcomes. What are your thoughts on prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy in this case?

The presentation of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema, bloating, and exertional chest tightness, combined with the recent weight gain, strongly suggests heart failure. The chest x-ray showing pericardial calcification and pleural effusions raises the possibility of constrictive pericarditis as the underlying cause. While the patient doesn't recall any history of pericarditis, it's possible they had a subclinical or undiagnosed episode in the past, given the calcification. The history of smoking, even though it ceased ten years ago, is a relevant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. My initial thoughts are that we need to differentiate between heart failure due to constrictive pericarditis and other causes of heart failure. To do this, I'd recommend an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function and look for signs of constriction, such as abnormal diastolic filling patterns and respirophasic variation in mitral inflow."

The echocardiogram should help clarify this, but I'm wondering if we should also consider ordering a coronary angiogram to assess for coronary artery disease, especially given the history of smoking.

While I understand MRI is generally preferred for pericardial assessment, given the extensive calcification seen on the chest x-ray, wouldn't a CT scan be more sensitive in detecting the extent and distribution of the calcification? Could the calcification potentially affect the quality of the MRI images, particularly in assessing pericardial thickness?

Also, while we're focusing on constrictive pericarditis, I'd like to revisit the patient's history of smoking and the possibility of co-existing coronary artery disease.

They also report a 20-pound weight loss over the same period. They have a history of asthma and dust/pollen allergies, and their inhaler use has increased without much relief. The initial differential included bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbation. The chest x-ray showing upper lobe-predominant peripheral and subpleural consolidations, combined with the pronounced hypereosinophilia on the CBC, points us in a different direction. The negative sputum culture argues against a common bacterial pneumonia.

While ABPA is certainly a strong possibility with the history of asthma and potential mold exposure, the x-ray pattern isn't quite as typical for ABPA, which often presents with central bronchiectasis. Could you share your thoughts on CEP as a differential in this case, and are there any other diagnostic tests you'd recommend to differentiate between these two conditions, or explore other possibilities? For example, would a high-resolution CT scan of the chest be helpful at this stage?

Given the patient's significant weight loss, should we consider other diagnoses, even if less likely? Could this be a manifestation of an underlying systemic vasculitis, perhaps Churg-Strauss syndrome (now known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EGPA), although the upper lobe predominance is less typical? Should we consider ANCA testing? 2. While the patient reported a musty basement, we don't have confirmation of Aspergillus exposure yet. Would it be helpful to perform environmental sampling of their home, specifically the basement, to identify the specific mold species present? This could provide more definitive evidence of exposure. 3."

Regarding environmental sampling, while I understand it's not always necessary, I'm leaning towards recommending it in this case. Given the patient's significant symptoms and the potential for ongoing exposure in their home, identifying the specific mold species could be valuable for both management and patient education regarding remediation. It could also help differentiate between Aspergillus and other less common fungal causes of ABPA-like presentations. I also wanted to clarify our next steps regarding imaging.

A brain MRI with contrast is a good next step. I'll also include an orbital MRI as you suggested, to rule out any subtle orbital pathology. Before ordering the MRIs, I'll revisit the patient history and specifically ask about any sensory symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or burning sensations, in the limbs or face. I'll also inquire about any history of Lhermitte's sign, which could be indicative of spinal cord involvement. While a demyelinating process is a possibility, the absence of other typical neurological symptoms makes me wonder if it's the primary driver here. The eyelid findings, combined with the blurry vision and leg weakness, still point towards a neuromuscular junction disorder as a strong possibility. Therefore, I'll proceed with the single-"

I'll also specifically look for any asymmetry between the two eyelids. One question I have is regarding the timing of the lumbar puncture. Would you recommend performing it before or after the MRIs? I'm leaning towards doing it after, as the MRI findings might influence the decision to proceed with a lumbar puncture, especially if they reveal an alternative explanation for the patient's symptoms. Regarding the possibility of a neuromuscular junction disorder, even if the serological tests (AChR and VGCC antibodies) come back negative, would you still consider pursuing repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber EMG if the clinical picture remains suggestive?"

Warm AIHA is also on the differential, of course.

If the eluate is negative for amoxicillin, would you consider a bone marrow biopsy to further investigate the cause of the hemolysis and rule out other underlying hematologic malignancies, even though the presentation is acute?

They report a chronic, now slightly worsening, dry cough and a recent increase in breathlessness. While they deny heartburn, they do describe indigestion as a pressure, sometimes felt in the throat like a lump they can't swallow, and a tickle in the throat after eating. They deny dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, fevers, or night sweats. No neck masses are palpable.

    "specialist_reason": "A **Dermatologist** is the most appropriate specialist. While the initial symptoms suggested a sexually transmitted infection (leading to STI testing), the negative results and the recurring nature of the sores, along with their description (itching, weeping fluid, scabbing), point towards a dermatological issue. The doctor is now considering autoimmune conditions which often manifest with skin symptoms, further reinforcing the need for a dermatologist's expertise. They are best equipped to diagnose and manage complex skin conditions, including those with an autoimmune basis."
