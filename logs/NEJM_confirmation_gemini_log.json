The patient presents with progressive facial darkening, described as blotchy with a bluish-brown discoloration and underlying redness, primarily affecting the cheeks, nose, and forehead. She reports mild itching and warmth, especially when flushed. Initially, the presentation suggested melasma, especially given her prior diagnosis and use of a skin-lightening cream. However, the biopsy results showing \"extracellular deposition of yellow-brown, banana-shaped bodies in the dermis\" clearly point towards ochronosis, most likely exogenous ochronosis given her history of hydroquinone use. My primary concern is confirming the connection between the hydroquinone cream and the ochronosis. While the two-year history of hydroquinone use is relatively short for developing ochronosis, it's not impossible, especially with daily application. I'd like to discuss the following: 1. **Concentration of hydroquinone:** What was the concentration of hydroquinone in the cream she was using?"

Beyond that, I'd like to explore a few other points: 1. **Frequency and duration of application:** While she mentioned daily use for two years, it would be helpful to know how much cream she applied each time and if there were any periods where she discontinued use. More frequent and generous application could contribute to ochronosis even within a shorter timeframe. 2. **Sun exposure habits:** Ochronosis can be exacerbated by sun exposure. While I've asked about her sunscreen use, I'd like to revisit this in more detail to assess her overall sun exposure and the consistency of her sun protection practices. 3. **Possibility of concomitant melasma:**"

If both conditions are present, how would you recommend we prioritize treatment? Should we focus on addressing the ochronosis first and then reassess for melasma, or is there a way to manage both simultaneously? I also wanted to ask about the patient's skin-lightening cream usage prior to the two years she's reported. She mentioned using a skin-lightening cream for melasma two years prior to the current discoloration. Do we know if that cream also contained hydroquinone? If so, her total exposure to hydroquinone could be significantly longer, which would further support the ochronosis diagnosis and potentially explain the relatively rapid onset.

My leading diagnosis is sarcoidosis, given the classic histopathological findings and the constellation of clinical and radiological features. However, the absence of any systemic symptoms and the normal PFTs are somewhat atypical. I have a few questions for you: 1. Do you agree with the presumptive diagnosis of sarcoidosis? Are there any"

My primary concern with just observation is the presence of the \"crazy paving\" pattern on the HRCT. While this can be seen in sarcoidosis, it's also associated with other interstitial lung diseases, some of which can be more aggressive. Even with normal PFTs, I'm hesitant to simply observe, especially given this radiographic finding. A couple of questions: 1. Would you consider a repeat bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy in a different lung segment? This could help confirm the uniformity of the granulomatous inflammation and potentially pick up any subtle findings missed on the first biopsy. 2.

However, I will take a much more detailed exposure history, specifically focusing on antigens associated with HP, such as bird droppings, mold, hot tub exposure, etc. Given the six-month history, if it *were* HP, I would expect to see some changes in PFTs, even subtle ones.

The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema also align with this diagnosis. The progressive nature of the symptoms over three years is also characteristic. However, the normal BNP level is somewhat unusual, although not unheard of in constrictive pericarditis. I've also thoroughly investigated potential underlying causes, and the patient denies any history of TB, radiation therapy, chest trauma, autoimmune disease, kidney disease, cancer, sarcoidosis, or heart surgery.

One thing that's been on my mind is the chronicity of this case \u2013 three years of progressively worsening symptoms. While constrictive pericarditis can certainly be a chronic condition, this timeframe makes me wonder if there might be something else contributing to the clinical picture. Could we be dealing with a mixed picture, perhaps with some element of restrictive cardiomyopathy as well? While the ventricular interdependence on the echo points towards constriction, I'd be interested to see the diastolic parameters in detail. Could you take a look at the E/e' ratio, left atrial volume index, and pulmonary venous flow velocities from the echocardiogram? These could help differentiate between constriction and restriction, or even suggest a combined pathology."

Given the borderline left atrial size, I think a cardiac MRI, as you suggested, would be very helpful to definitively differentiate between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, and to potentially identify any other underlying myocardial abnormalities.

The patient's persistent bloating and sensation of fullness, despite normal weight and no other GI symptoms, are still somewhat puzzling. While this can be a symptom of constrictive pericarditis due to elevated venous pressure, it's prominent in this case even with relatively mild peripheral edema. I'm wondering if there could be another process at play, perhaps something affecting hepatic venous return or even something less common like a subclinical hypothyroidism contributing to fluid retention. Should we consider adding liver function tests and thyroid function tests to the next round of bloodwork, just to be thorough? Secondly, while the patient denies any relevant travel history, I'm still slightly concerned about the possibility of a less common infectious etiology, especially given"

However, the biopsy showed no evidence of lymphoma, and the serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgG monoclonal gammopathy. This, combined with new reports of back pain and paresthesias extending beyond the hands, raises concern for a systemic process potentially involving the bone marrow and peripheral nerves. My primary question is: Do you think the monoclonal gammopathy is driving the skin findings, or are they separate processes?

My initial thoughts were meniscal tear, ligament damage, or even patellar subluxation, but the normal imaging makes these less likely. The patient describes a feeling of the knees being \"locked\" and a \"pulling tightness\" which, combined with the limited extension, raises the possibility of something like a cyclops lesion or arthrofibrosis, although the bilateral presentation is atypical for these.

I haven't checked a sedimentation rate or CRP yet, but that's a good suggestion and I'll order those tests. Regarding pseudogout, while possible, the patient doesn't describe acute, intensely painful episodes typical of that condition. The chronicity and persistent nature of the symptoms seem less characteristic of pseudogout. Given the patient's kidney disease and the medications they're taking (phosphate binders and calcitriol), I'm also wondering about the possibility of calciphylaxis, although the presentation seems atypical. Have you seen cases of calciphylaxis affecting the knees with this type of presentation? It might be worth checking calcium and phosphorus levels as well. The lack of response to ibuprofen also makes me question whether the pain is truly inflammatory in nature.

It seems like a more systemic process might be at play. Before considering arthroscopy, I'd like to explore a few other avenues. First, given the patient's history of kidney disease and use of phosphate binders, could this be a form of soft tissue calcification or even a tumoral calcinosis, even if it's not classic calciphylaxis? Would a CT scan be more helpful than another MRI in visualizing these types of calcifications around the knee joint? Second, I'm curious about the patient's medication for pain. They mentioned"

I'll definitely check the vitamin D level as you suggested, as muscle weakness contributing to the perceived \"locking\" is a plausible explanation. While the inflammatory markers are normal, I'll still proceed with the rheumatology consult to thoroughly rule out inflammatory arthropathies, especially given the bilateral presentation. Perhaps there's a low-grade inflammatory process not reflected in the standard markers. Given the patient's report of minimal relief with ibuprofen, I'm leaning towards a non-inflammatory process as the primary driver of the symptoms. Could the \"pulling tightness\" the patient describes be related to muscle contractures or even a neurological issue affecting muscle tone?"

However, the negative shingles antibody blood test throws a wrench in the works. The patient's use of a topical corticosteroid cream might have altered the appearance of the rash, making diagnosis more challenging. My primary concern now, given the negative serology, is to consider other diagnoses that mimic zoster. I'd like your opinion on a few possibilities: 1. **Atypical zoster:** Could this be a case of zoster sine herpete, where the pain precedes the rash, or zoster with an atypical presentation due to the corticosteroid use?

Should we also consider other causes of pulmonary eosinophilia, such as Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) or hypereosinophilic syndrome? While the patient didn't report any other organ involvement, I'd like your opinion on whether these warrant further investigation at this stage.

My primary concern is the combination of the lower eyelid abnormality and the blurring vision, especially given the normal OCT.

Regarding the globe, during the dilated exam, I did note that the eyes appeared somewhat dome-shaped, which seemed to be contributing to the lower lid indentation. It wasn't a dramatic proptosis, but there was a subtle anterior displacement of the corneal apex. Corneal topography would be helpful to quantify any changes in curvature since the transplant.

A neck CT with contrast is an excellent suggestion as well, especially to assess for any potential lymph node involvement. Did the pathology report mention anything about dysplasia or atypical cells in the initial biopsy sample, even if it was predominantly consistent with *Candida*? Also, could you clarify what you consider \"suspicious areas\" during the repeat laryngoscopy? Should we be focusing on areas beyond the visible plaques, perhaps areas of erythema, thickening, or irregularity?

I'm assuming FDG would be standard, but are there any other tracers you'd recommend considering in this specific case? Second, while we await the results of these tests, should we initiate any empiric antifungal treatment for the *Candida* laryngitis? I'm hesitant to do so before obtaining the deeper biopsies and further imaging, as it could potentially mask any underlying pathology or interfere with the interpretation of the PET scan.

Infectious disease specialists are best equipped to diagnose and manage infections in patients with HIV, including less common STIs and other opportunistic infections that might manifest with skin lesions.

The negative HSV PCR and serology are helpful, but the cyclical nature, prodromal itching/burning, and tender inguinal nodes still point towards an infectious etiology, especially in the context of his HIV. While he reports his HIV is managed, the increased fatigue raises a flag about possible suboptimal control, which could predispose him to opportunistic infections. My primary differential at this point includes: 1. **Syphilis:** While he denies a prior diagnosis, testing for syphilis is crucial given his HIV status and sexual activity. Atypical presentations are possible, and we need to rule this out definitively. I'd recommend a RPR and confirmatory treponemal test. 2. **Chancroid:** Given the painful, ulcerative nature of the lesions and the reported weeping, chancroid is a possibility.

Also, to further characterize the adenopathy, is it unilateral or bilateral? Is it painful, fluctuant, or matted? Regarding his HIV management, I'll absolutely order an HIV viral load and CD4 count. When was his last CD4 count and viral load checked, and what were the results? This will help us assess his current immune status and guide further management. While less likely given the negative HSV tests, could the recurrence be related to a different herpesvirus, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV)? Has he ever had chickenpox or shingles? Although"

Beyond the tests we've discussed, I'm also considering the possibility of a non-infectious etiology, albeit less likely given the presentation. Could this be a fixed drug eruption, recurring in the same location due to repeated exposure to a causative medication, even an over-the-counter one? I'll ask him about any medications he uses regularly, including any topical creams or ointments.

Before we proceed with a biopsy, I'd like to gather a bit more information to help prioritize the most likely diagnoses.

Granuloma inguinale often leads to scarring, while syphilis and chancroid typically heal without significant scarring.
